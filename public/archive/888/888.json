    "Editorial": "<p>This editorial was brought to you by kikocat :) <p><b>Why can’t I put a picture for the beauty contest~~black_black5</b><br>There are many reasons why you could be having an issue entering. The image could be in the wrong file format (.gif or .jpg file.) Also, make sure that your file is under 75 kbs and the filename is all in lower case letters. If that still doesn't work, try using a different browser. And if you are still stuck, you can head to the Art Board and ask for help there. There are always Beauty Contest regulars around to lend a hand. <p><b>Hi TNT, please can you clarify a couple of rules regarding side accounts. 1) If we only have the lab ray on our side account and want to battle the Lab Ray Scientist JUST to change the gender of our pet, are we allowed to? Assuming we make zero attempt to win the battle and withdraw from the battle as soon as the gender is changed (so no prizes). 2) If we only have the lab ray on our side account, are we allowed to use the lab ray cookies? 3) Is 2 player battling allowed on side accounts, assuming all weapons and faerie abilities are funded from our main account? Thanks :)</b><br>Hi, 1) No, you cannot use the battledome on side accounts; this is because there are prizes given out for winning. If you want to use the battledome to change the gender of a pet, it would be best to transfer the pet to your main, fight there and once you have gotten the change, move your pet back to your side account. 2) Yes, if you only have the lab ray on your side account, then you would be able to use the lab ray cookies on that account. However, if you ever get the lab ray on your main account, you would then only be able to use the cookies on that account. 3) Since you do not receive any points or items from 2 player battles that would be fine but just keep funding these from your main. <p><b>My BC entry was deleted for posting it on an outside site, I, and some friends, are wondering - though - if sending the link via neomail, or posting the link on our User Lookup is fine, or it's against the rules too. Thank you in advance!~~martia_elior </b><br>Hi, sorry to hear your entry was removed, however posting a link on your User Lookup or sending to your Neofriends is fine. However, please do not send to people who are not your Neofriends since that could be viewed as spam. <p><b>So in the last editorial you said images need to come from neopets.com OR a public image server site. Does this mean I can upload a picture of my neopet customized a certain way to a website like Imgur and use that image in my article? Just wanted this clarified for future entries I have in mind. Thank you! - _clows_cool_pets </b><br>Yes you got it! <p><b>I've noticed that my Vandagyre can't wear a lot of the older NC clothes. Is there a reason for this? Practically half of my closet is useless apart from backgrounds :( ~~krisdaniel </b><br>As you know, the Vandagyre came out in November 2015 to celebrate our 15th birthday but sadly that means a lot of wearables from before then would not be able to be worn by them. <p><b>Hi! Does NC still expire? The NC shopping rules page states that, \"Neocash will expire after one year and that upon expiration you will be given a Neocash Item of equal or greater value.\" However some players have noticed that unused NC no longer seems to expire. It'd be lovely if you could check in on this & let us know if things have changed. </b><br>They would be correct, NC no longer expires. Oops, that should probably be updated. We'll find someone who can check into that for us. Sorry about the confusion. <p><b>A lot of users in the art community would like to revisit allowing Neopets users to open up commissions for their art and receive Neopoints or items as payment. I think we can agree anything off site or real life currency related shouldn't be allowed and can be reported. And the community would have to understand the consequences of possible scams and take our own precautions. I don't think TNT should have to be stressed with policing commissions and there could be a disclaimer on the Art board explaining this risk. Allowing commissions would be a great way to get the art community bustling and more involved with each other and also non-artists or HTML savvy people. It also encourages people to begin drawing or picking up HTML and to keep improving! Not to mention there would be even more great Neopets art on petpages, userlookups, and descriptions. It also gives a way for those of us who aren't that great at restocking to work for our Neopoints and reach our goals. </b><br>This has been discussed in previous editorials, however we would not be able to allow members to do commissions for Neopets Intellectual Property. You are welcome to do Art Trades with one another but you would not be able to charge Neopoints, real life money or items for those images. <p><b>Hi Jade! Is the nt_editor account still the best way to contact you regarding missing NT trophies or publications? Or should we file a ticket and have the support team deal with those issues? I noticed my trophy count did not increase with the collab comic for the holiday issue, and one of my old comics is glitched where it doesn’t show up when you search my username. Thanks! </b><br>Hello!! To clear this up, collaborators trophies have to be manually added after each NT comes out, so those are usually added early the next week. If you have not received the trophy please send in a ticket and include the URL to your submission. Just a side note, if you are doing a collaboration with someone please make sure to include their name or names in the comments so they can get credit. <center><img src=//images.neopets.com/caption/caption_670.gif>"

      "Piece": "<p>�����A Guide to Nimmo�s Pond</p><p>�����A long long time ago, there was no life on Neopia. The air was covered in cloudy poisonous smog and there was no life, with the exception of Dr. Sloth because he is just super old and basically invincible. One day, a hole broke through that smoggy barrier and light hit the planet of Neopia, suddenly beginning to appear on the planet at an exponentially quick rate. Plants started to cover the terrain and neopets began to randomly appear. Dr. Sloth was baffled. It is my firm belief that whatever chemical, or thing, made Neopia grow is still in that Nimmo�s Pond. Those lily pads are endless and they never stop coming!</p><p>�����It is quite amusing because when you start the game, Nimmo�s Pond, there is a Nimmo (your main character) just chillin� out in the middle of the pond and looking super zen. This game will give you anxiety. It is false advertising! </p><p>�����Today I am going to teach you about how we can manage that anxiety and hopefully earn you an avatar or a trophy. As you should, before playing any new game, go ahead and open up the instructions. I have lost many games by not doing this so I am going to tell you to do it now because I am sure that others are going to do it. </p><p>�����Introduction:</p><p>�����Once you open up the instructions, it will tell you a little bit about the game. Your job is to guide the nimmo around the pond without touching any of the lily pads, because obviously they are super sharp and explosive. When you detonate the super sharp explosive lily pads they will blow up and make more smaller super sharp and explosive lily pads. Do NOT touch the lily pads - only the pad your nimmo is floating on is safe from being super sharp and explosive. The fact that the giant lily pads blow up into smaller lily pads only furthers my belief of the super rare chemical that causes things to grow theory. Just saying.</p><p>�����Controls:</p><p>�����You can use your arrow keys to paddle around the pond. The up arrow is basically your gas pedal; it makes your nimmo move when he literally lets out exhaust (from using the gas pedal) to propel his lily pad. The left/right arrow keys allow you to turn/steer your lily pad. The down arrow key, well, the nimmo hasn�t figured this one out yet, rendering it absolutely useless. If you want to go back the other way, you have to turn all the way around using the left/right arrow keys.</p><p>�����The space bar is your friend. Basically, using the spacebar, your nimmo will shoot projectiles (#whydontothernimmoshavethispower?) just as fast as you can smash that button. His projectile will propel across the screen and blows up super razor sharp lily pads (which is pretty lucky). We will talk about his different kinds of projectiles in just a moment. </p><p>�����The �B� key is very important. Pressing �B� will let out a giant bomb that will explode all of the lily pads on screen and put them into their next lowest form. Use these sparingly; you will need them in tricky situations. You start with three bombs.</p><p>�����Last is the �V� key. Pressing the �V� key will stick out the nimmo�s tongue to eat power ups that are floating around the game. The nimmo, as mentioned, shoots projectile ammo at the lily pads to stay alive. Occasionally you will see some power-ups floating around. When the nimmo eats a power-up, he gets a new special kind of projectile: artillery power, health, or power restoration. Also, your weapon power-ups can level up!</p><p>�����All power-ups are seen as floating bubbles with symbols on them. Here is a list of power-ups:</p><p>�����Red Cross: This (obviously) heals you. Don�t eat these until you actually have to.</p><p>�����Yellow/Green Bug - Replenishes your paddle power (clearly since it appears to be electrical, this makes sense).</p><p>�����Red Bomb: Gives you a bomb. Only eat this if you have already used a bomb.</p><p>�����Green Star: This is your starting weapon. You want to avoid this if it is not still your current weapon. The green star shoots in one line rapid fire.</p><p>�����Yellow Star: This weapon shoots three projectiles at a time. In my opinion, this is the best weapon. Get this one.</p><p>�����Red Orb: Shoots high-powered strong projectiles. This is a short range weapon, so avoid it.</p><p>�����Blue Candy: Resets the speed of the nimmo�s pad.</p><p>�����Your goal is to achieve 4,000 points to get your Nimmo�s Pond avatar. My biggest tips are listed below: </p><p>�����1. Never move from your starting position unless you ABSOLUTELY have to. We mentioned earlier that you can press the UP key to make the nimmo move. Don�t do it! Moving causes your nimmo to use paddle power. Remember the exhaust? The exhaust basically excreets a gas, and gas floats. If your nimmo runs out of gas, he will sink and you will lose the game. I typically try to make my nimmo not move for the entire game. In my opinion, the best thing that you can do is to control your space. I know others who disagree, but I find this method a lot easier to manage. It is harder to track the lily pads and yourself. Why not just track the lily pads?</p><p>�����2. Turning will use paddle power, so watch your paddle power meter from time to time. When your nimmo sits still, your paddle power will replenish; your nimmo can ride currents, but if you use any of the keys mentioned previously, you cannot replenish your paddle power.</p><p>�����3. At the start of the match, watch to see how aggressively quick the lily pads are moving. If they are coming straight at you and you can�t stop them, use a bomb. Hopefully you can replenish a bomb with a power-up in the near future. </p><p>�����4. At the end of each match, leave on lily pad so you can clear any unnecessary power-ups and replenish your paddle power before the next match. Power-ups to leave alone until you absolutely need them: health and bombs. Power-ups to clear: blue candy, yellow/green bug, and if you have maxed out your weapon power level, you can clear that as well.</p><p>�����5. It is incredibly hard to aim, meaning it is extremely important to get the yellow power-ups as soon as possible. While you are waiting, using the left and right arrows quickly to swivel back and forth can help get those awkward shots into your targets. Remember to watch your paddle power though!</p><p>�����6. At all costs, try to prevent BIG lily pads from crashing into you. If they do, they let out smaller lily pads which could just automatically blow up into you as well, making you will lose; this is how you lose in later levels. The pads get so fast at the start of the level you basically start and die. </p><p>�����7. There is a power-up that is random. It will change at random speeds and tempt you by appearing as various power-ups (health, a bomb, or in rare situations, a power-up). Avoid this unless you absolutely need it. It is very risky, as you may try to catch this power-up, and it could change into a weapon you don�t want. Example: going from a level 5 yellow star to a level 1 green star would be terrible!</p><p>�����8. Last thing you need to know: The pond is also a magical portal. If you or a lily pad goes to the screen on the far left side, you or the lily pad will reappear on the right side. If you or a lily pad goes to the top of the screen, you or the lily pad will appear on the bottom. The same is true for the opposite directions as well. This is the easiest way to remember how to track your lily pads. Unfortunately, the portals do not work with your projectiles. </p><p>�����Well, that is all. I hope you enjoyed the read and I hope that I only spoiled lunch for a few people today. </p><p>�����See you again in another issue. </p>"

These looks are intended to spark inspiration and creativity in Elephante owners, and show them how to utilize their Elephantes closet in different ways. Let`s dive in and look at what kind out outfits this elegant species has to work with.</p><p>�����Jack</p><p>�����</p><center><img src=https://openneo-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/outfits/001/970/866/medium_preview.png></center><p>�����Items used:</p><p>�����Combatant Elephante Spear</p><p>�����Dark Hooded Elephante Tunic</p><p>�����Elephante Professor Wig</p><p>�����Elephante Bard Boots</p><p>�����Members Only Moustache</p><p>�����Jack of All Decks Foreground and Background</p><p>�����The spades symbols on the tunic inspired me to create this look, inspired by the Jack in the deck of cards. Luckily we have the perfect background!</p><p>�����For a more kingly look, use Kings Crown and Wig and Ancient Shenkuu Staff.</p><p>�����Facial hair usually doesn`t look good on Elephantes due to their trunk. A moustache might be placed right on the middle of their trunk, looking odd and misplaced. If you want to add a beard to your jack/king for this look, I recommend MiniMME15-S2a: Daring Seafarer Beard and Snowy White Fake Beard as they both look decent.</p><p>�����Also try: Dented Imperial Exam Guards Helm</p><p>�����Oh Captain, My Captain</p><p>�����</p><center><img src=https://openneo-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/outfits/001/971/445/medium_preview.png></center><p>�����Items used:</p><p>�����Delivery Elephante Shirt and Shoes</p><p>�����Daring Sea Captain Hat</p><p>�����Scrap Stowaway Collectors Background</p><p>�����Nautical Trousers</p><p>�����Nautical Souvenirs Garland</p><p>�����Captain Tuans Collectors Telescope</p><p>�����The Delivery/milkman set doesn`t inspire a wide variety of looks, but by simply swapping the hat for a Sea Captain Hat, the look is instantly changed and your attention is drawn to the anchor logo on the hat rather than to the milk bottle on the Elephantes shoulder. You can use the white Delivery trousers if you wish, but I chose the Nautical ones here to break up the white set and make the whole customization a bit more colourful and interesting. </p><p>�����Also try: Boat Day Background for a more modern look. Daring Sea Captain Ship Background and Ship Ropes Garland also work well for an Elephante captain look.</p><p>�����If you want to stick to the delivery theme, use Neopia Central Neohome Background with Valentine Delivery Bag (and Valentines Day Mailbox if you wish, for extra detail) but for that customization I recommend using the complete Delivery Elephante set to complete the mailman look.</p><p>�����Pretty Ballerina</p><p>�����</p><center><img src=https://openneo-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/outfits/001/971/460/medium_preview.png></center><p>�����Items used:</p><p>�����Elephante Ballerina Tutu, Rose, Tights and Shoes</p><p>�����Fancy Elephante Wig</p><p>�����Elephante Flapper Necklace</p><p>�����Neopies Stage Background</p><p>�����Fire Faerie Eye Shadow</p><p>�����Candlelit Opera Stage Foreground</p><p>����� ����Also try: Opera Stage Background or Sparkling Red Stage Background together with Conductors Stand Foreground.</p><p>�����Your Elephante is the first lady of the stage in this pretty ballerina set. I quite like the dark colours chosen for this ensemble, and chose to use the Fancy Elephante Wig as is compliments the outfit and style perfectly. The necklace for added for the sake of detail and it gives you the opportunity to decide if your Elephante is a dancer or a singer. I love the lush red stage curtain and the elegant golden tassels in the background, very classy.</p><p>�����Thief</p><p>�����</p><center><img src=https://openneo-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/outfits/001/972/142/medium_preview.png></center><p>�����Items used:</p><p>�����Dark Hooded Elephante Cloak</p><p>�����Dark Hooded Elephante Gloves</p><p>�����Combatant Elephante Shoes</p><p>�����MiniMME15-S1: Daring Seafarer Tunic</p><p>�����Thieves Guild Background</p><p>�����Shiny Bag of Gold Coins</p><p>�����Scarred Pirate Eye</p><p>�����Also try: Smugglers Cove Background, Thiefs Den Background, MME19-S2b: Menacing Plague Doctor Tunic, Shenkuu Apprentice Tunic, Thieving Boots.</p><p>�����The Scarred Pirate Eye is added for dramatic effect and to add character to your Elephantes expression, which can be used to tell a story or underline a character trait. You don`t compromise the overall look if you choose to leave it out. </p><p>�����The Dark Hooded Elephante Cloak looks a lot like Kanriks Collectors Cloak and Cape, which is why I went with a thief look based around that item. </p><p>�����Gypsy</p><p>�����</p><center><img src=https://openneo-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/outfits/001/972/153/medium_preview.png></center><p>�����Items used:</p><p>�����Elephante Fortune Teller Wig, Skirt, Shirt, Belt and Cards</p><p>�����Elephante Flapper Gloves and Shoes</p><p>�����Haunted Faire Background</p><p>�����Dark Faerie Eye Shadow</p><p>�����Gypsy Girl Shawl</p><p>�����Cheery Bonfire</p><p>�����Gypsy Wagon</p><p>�����Dyeworks Black: Light Damask Markings</p><p>�����Also try: Colourful Campfire Background, Off The Beaten Path, Cannibal Bonfire, Camping at the Altador Cup, Fortune-Telling Crystal Ball.</p><p>�����The Dark Faerie Eye Shadow adds an interesting expression to the Elephante's face in addition to nicely matching the purple tones of her outfit. In combination with the rolling fog and the animated campfire, you`re intrigued and drawn in by the scene and curious about this gypsy Elephante. Is she a simple fortune teller ready to read cards for you, or is she a cunning witch about to cast an evil spell? Join her by the campfire and you`ll soon find out...</p><p>����� ����Thank You For The Music</p><p>�����</p><center><img src=https://openneo-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/outfits/001/983/550/medium_preview.png></center><p>�����Items used:</p><p>�����Elephante Bard Wig, Trousers, Shirt, Boots, Cape, Mandolin.</p><p>�����King Skarl Throne Background</p><p>�����Meridellian Feast</p><p>�����My favourite piece in this ensemble is the wig! I love the long, flowing brown locks that can just as easily belong to a rockstar as to a middle ages musician. It can be used for female Elephantes as well. The trousers and boots can also be easily repurposed in other outfits for males, and the neat, red cape can be used in a Little Red Riding Hood customization or perhaps as part of a playful, home-made super hero costume.</p><p>�����In this example, the Elephante Bard has arrived in Meridell to sing at the court of King Skarl as entertainment to the guests at the grand banquet. If he plays and sings well, perhaps the King will reward him with some scraps from the table?</p><p>����� ����Chef</p><p>�����</p><center><img src=https://openneo-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/outfits/001/983/557/medium_preview.png></center><p>�����Items used:</p><p>�����Elephante Sushi Chef Shirt, Sandals, Headband (set also includes a knife)</p><p>�����Elephante Marching Band Gloves</p><p>�����Turmac Sushi Roll</p><p>�����Mystery Island Training Academy Garden Background</p><p>�����Island Chef Academy Counter</p><p>�����You can give your Elephante a chefs hat and put him in a kitchen background to make it look like he works at a restaurant, but I went with a bit more exotic approach here with using the Island Chef Academy Counter, best suited with an outdoor setting.</p><p>�����On The Slopes</p><p>�����</p><center><img src=https://openneo-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/outfits/001/983/564/medium_preview.png></center><p>�����Items used:</p><p>�����Stylish Elephante Goggles</p><p>�����Stylish Elephante Pants</p><p>�����Pink Elephante Parka</p><p>�����Combatant Elephante Wig</p><p>�����Pretty Swirl Skis</p><p>�����Hit the Slopes Background</p><p>�����TNT Mantra Coffee Mug</p><p>�����This is an example of how you might combine items from different clothing sets to create a new ensemble. The wig is originally from a warrior-themed set, but works well on a female Elephante as well. The glasses and trousers/boots are from the same set, also originally made for a male pet. If the pink parka is from a full set, I haven`t been able to locate the other items, so it appears to be a standalone. It`s a cute, feminine item that works well in the wintersport setting we`ve made here.</p><p>�����I hope you enjoyed looking through the selected customizations of Elephantes sporting their tailor-made species clothing! Check out my other entries in this series, and don`t hesitate to drop me a Neomail if you have any comments, or suggestions of which Neopet I should write about next.</p><p>�����Thank you for reading, and have a very happy Elephante Day! </p>"

      "Piece": "<p>�����A new year means a fresh chance to start over and live your best life. Here in Neopia we have entered the glorious Year 22! New beginnings and fresh starts can take place in all sorts of ways, but the best way to get spiffy for the 365 days ahead is to be on trend. I�ve compiled a list predicting the most fashionable color trends for each month of Year 22! </p><p>�����Joining me today I have fashionista and color expert, darthparris. Darthparris is a rising star in Neopia and deserves some recognition for their color aptitude. </p><p>�����darthparris: Thank you very much! This is going to be a great year for all sorts of Neopets no matter what color they are. </p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: Because it�s what�s on the inside that matters, right? </p><p>�����darthparris: Something like that. Let�s begin! </p><p>�����1. Month of Sleeping--Woodland</p><p>�����darthparris: The Month of Sleeping is not traditionally associated with nature. It is a cold and icy time, but the Woodland color represents a return to nature and inner-peace. If you have a Woodland pet, you will feel an aura of tranquility. </p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: So, about how much would this cost? Is this a good choice for new players? </p><p>�����darthparris: Unfortunately the price for this paint brush is a bit steep as it boasts a price tag of over 1 million Neopoints. However, if you�re feeling lucky, you could try your chances at the Alien Aisha Vending Machine. </p><p>����� ����Our Favorite Woodland Neopets: Woodland Cybunny, Woodland Grundo, Woodland Usul </p><p>�����2. Month of Awakening--Candy </p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: What a wonderful choice for those of us with a sweet tooth. Can you tell us a little bit about this choice? </p><p>�����darthparris: Of course! While it might be traditional to go with Chocolate for Chocolate Chia Day, I propose that the color of the month is actually Candy! This is thematically appropriate for Valentine�s Day and is relevant all year long. Who doesn�t like candy? </p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: Right you are. Around how much would this cost?</p><p>�����darthparris: Another steep one, but well worth it. A Candy Paint Brush costs around 3 million Neopoints. Again, Nerkmids can be a real savior here! </p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: As they often are! </p><p>�����Our Favorite Candy Neopets: </p><p>�����Candy Acara, Candy Aisha, Candy Kougra</p><p>�����3. Month of Running- Eventide</p><p>�����darthparris: This beautiful color is one of my all-time favorites. Its gradient represents the transition from dark, wintery days into warm spring sunsets. The stars are unique on each Neopet. This is a truly remarkable color!</p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: Right you are! A marvelous color, and from what I hear, this one will also set you back a few Neopoints. </p><p>�����darthparris: Yes, it seems that the color trends right now are erring on the side of more expensive. Stay tuned for the end of the article where I will list some alternatives for those Neopians who are a little down on their luck. Paint brushes can be for everyone! </p><p>�����4. Month of Eating- Water</p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: I presume this is because of the rainy season? </p><p>�����darthparris: Absolutely correct! This color is ethereal and mystical. Just make sure you don�t lose your Neopet in Maraqua! This is so much better than the traditional Grey!</p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: Where could I get this paint brush? </p><p>�����darthparris: Again, the Alien Aisha Vending Machine is an option. You can also get this brush from Fruit Machine or you could always buy it. It sells for around 1.5 million Neopoints. </p><p>�����Our Favorite Water Neopets: Water Blumaroo, Water Peophin, Water Shoyru</p><p>�����5. Month of Hunting- Plushie </p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: What an interesting choice for the month of hunting? Could you explain the reasoning behind this one? </p><p>�����darthparris: Sure! The Month of Hunting seems rather mean, so I predict that Neopians will want to be a bit more peaceful. So, that means that the Month of Hunting should be the Month of Hugging, and what better to hug than a Plushie Neopet? </p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: I couldn�t agree more! How much would the paint brush cost? </p><p>�����darthparris: This is also an expensive paint brush--it costs around 2.5 million Neopoints. </p><p>�����Our Favorite Plushie Neopets: </p><p>�����Plushie Gnorbu, Plushie Jetsam, Plushie Tonu </p><p>�����6. Month of Relaxing-Maraquan </p><p>�����darthparris: The hot summer months call for a pet that can be in the water as it pleases! Therefore, I highly recommend that you get yourself a Maraquan pet for the Month of Relaxing. </p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: Nothing says relaxing like a nice dip in the pleasant Maraquan waters! How would I get this type of Neopet? </p><p>�����darthparris: For about 3.5 million Neopoints, or else considerable luck with random events, you can have a Maraquan Neopet!</p><p>�����Our Favorite Maraquan Neopets: </p><p>�����Maraquan Jubjub, Maraquan Kacheek, Maraquan Shoyru </p><p>�����7. Month of Swimming--Invisible</p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: Now, I think Water or Maraquan would have fit better with the Month of Swimming...Could you explain your reasoning here? </p><p>�����darthparris: Naturally! Fashion is fickle and predictability is not fashionable. Having a Invisible pet is so much fun for pulling pranks during the Month of Swimming! </p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: How much do you have to spend for a pet you can�t see? </p><p>�����darthparris: Around 1 million Neopoints should suffice!</p><p>����� ����Our Favorite Invisible Pets: </p><p>�����Invisible Ixi, Invisible Wocky, Invisible Zafara</p><p>�����8. Month of Hiding-Baby </p><p>�����darthparris: The Month of Hiding is a wonderful time. Neoschool is just about to begin and every Neopet is getting ready for their own adventure. I suggest that you try to hold onto your youth for a little while longer by painting your Neopet Baby!</p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: An excellent suggestion! And I believe that this is not quite as expensive, since the Baby Paint Brush stocks at the Hidden Tower. </p><p>�����darthparris: Absolutely correct! This will only set you back around 600,000 Neopoints. </p><p>�����Our Favorite Baby Pets: </p><p>�����Baby Buzz, Baby Grundo, Baby Pteri </p><p>����� ����9. Month of Gathering-Pastel</p><p>�����darthparris: Pastel is a lovely color with autumnal vibes. It is great for shy Neopets who might not want to be super vibrant. </p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: A brilliant choice for those who want a change, but not too much of a change! How much would this cost? </p><p>�����darthparris: Around 4 million Neopoints, but well worth it! </p><p>�����Our Favorite Pastel Neopets: </p><p>�����Pastel Koi, Pastel Ruki, Pastel Xweetok</p><p>�����10. Month of Collecting- Wraith </p><p>�����darthparris: This is my favorite color, personally. The sharp purple outlines with the misty violet tones are mysterious and ferocious. </p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: An absolutely splendid color! What is it worth? </p><p>�����darthparris: A Wraith Paint Brush costs around 2.5 million Neopoints! </p><p>�����Our Favorite Wraith Pets: </p><p>�����Wraith Lupe, Wraith Shoyru, Wraith Jubjub</p><p>�����11. Month of Storing--Ice </p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: What a unique color! Tell us more about this choice. </p><p>�����darthparris: This color is perfect to help Neopets transition to the cold winter days. It is suitable for Neopets who like cold weather. </p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: Wonderful! Where could one get this lovely color? </p><p>�����darthparris: This is a very exclusive color--there is no paint brush. The only way to obtain this color is via the Lab Ray. </p><p>�����Our Favorite Ice Neopets: </p><p>�����Ice Aisha, Ice Bruce, Ice Chomby </p><p>�����12. Month of Celebrating-Toy</p><p>�����darthparris: There�s no better way to finish up the year than with the Month of Celebrating! For this magnificent month, I recommend painting your Neopet Toy. This fun color is vibrant and appealing for Neopians of all ages. </p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: I couldn�t agree more! How can one obtain this color? </p><p>�����darthparris: It sells for around 1.5 million Neopoints. </p><p>�����Our Favorite Toy Neopets: </p><p>�����Toy Kiko, Toy Kyrii, Toy Pteri </p><p>����� kaitlinhoneybee: Well, this was a wonderfully informative interview. The colors of the year sure are exciting. I just have one brief follow-up question for us Neopians who aren�t quite so rich. Are there any alternative colors that are in style for the year? </p><p>�����darthparris: There sure are. Thanks for asking. Here�s a brief list of some more affordable options with prices listed. </p><p>�����1.To capture that natural vibe, try substituting with a Strawberry Fields Forever Paint Brush. Cost: 150,000 Neopoints. </p><p>�����2. A Biscuit Paint Brush embodies sweetness! Cost: 180,000 Neopoints.</p><p>�����3. Let your Neopet shine with the starry design of the Starry Paint Brush. Cost: 100,000 Neopoints.</p><p>����� ����4. Silver represents the rippling of water. A Silver Paint Brush will delight any Neopet! Cost: 200,000 Neopoints. </p><p>�����5. Cloud is just as soft as plushie! Use a Cloud Paint Brush to reach for the sky. Cost: 110,000 Neopoints. </p><p>�����6. Electric blue is a striking color for pets who live in Maraqua. An Electric Blue Paint Brush shows spunk. Cost: 480,000 Neopoints. </p><p>�����7. Can�t afford an invisible Neopet? The Scritchy Sketchy Paint Brush is the solution! Cost: 60,000 Neopoints. </p><p>�����8. Not in the mood for a Baby Pet? Try a Split Pet instead! Cost: 70,000 Neopoints. </p><p>�����9. A Striped Paint Brush provides the same tame color palette as the Pastel Paint Brush for a much lower price. Cost: 200,000 Neopoints. </p><p>�����10. Looking for a Halloween costume? Try a Ghost Paint Brush! Cost: 250,000 Neopoints. </p><p>�����11. Ice is extremely exclusive. Not everyone can afford the Lab Ray, but a few consecutive spins of Trudy�s Surprise can give you enough Neopoints to afford a Snow Paint Brush! Cost: 45,000 Neopoints. </p><p>�����12. Toy is a wonderful, colorful color. What else is colorful? A rainbow of course! Buy your Neopet this paint brush. Cost: 500,000 Neopoints. </p><p>�����kaitlinhoneybee: Thank you, darthparris, for these predictions! I can�t wait to see what Year 22 holds!</p><p>�����darthparris: Likewise! Keep fit and keep fashionable! </p><p>����� </p>"

      "Filename": "580121",
      "Piece": "<p>�����Few times in your travels will you happen upon a figure in as much high regard as the Honorable Dr. Sloth. But when you are finally graced with his presence, you will realize that you have two options; To be ignored like the Grundo-esque being that you are, or to be acknowledged as one of the inner circle of the Minion Elite. When it is the latter, you will know that you are truly being awarded rather than punished and forced to the mines on Kreludor. However Sloth cannot let moments of weakness via gratitude bring forth ideas of possible resistance. No, instead, he cleverly hides his true intentions in plain site. </p><p>�����You see, it is not enough for someone to just say that they are ready for the life of Sloth. You have to prove it to him. He has eyes all over Neopia, entrusting his Minion Elite to recruit new initiates. Many have spoken ill about Dr. Sloth. So many lies, and misrepresentations of the Honorable Sloth have been seeded into the minds of the youth. But Dr. Sloth is not an evil man, no. He merely has been painted in a bad light and even wrongly published into the Gallery of Evil. Would a man so vile as they describe him, liberate a whole planet of Grundos and bring them into an age of technology and wealth? Would a man that disagreeable have fought for the best interests of the Neopians all over the world, not once, but twice? Could someone as astute as Dr. Sloth be capable of actually enslaving a planet to further his own goals? I think not. Manipulation is a forced description of Dr. Sloth. One fabricated by those who wish to undo his hard work.</p><p>�����\"But,\" I hear you say, \"what about the horrible technology that he has used in the past?\"</p><p>�����These are just more fabrications to discredit the good doctor. Take the transmogrification potions which he bestows upon certain individuals. That is right, all lies. The real Dr. Sloth was tenured in to make some of the best cures for your Diseases. Blurred VIsion, Floppy Tongue, or even Hoochie Coochies; Dr. Sloth had a huge part in developing and researching formulas to cure such ailments. Because of this, some have seen it fit to make a robot replica of the Honorable Sloth to further bring a fall from accreditation. Enslavement and the horrors on Kreludor? All bedtime stories to deter those away from the glory that is Sloth. Someone as capable as he of contributing to studying remedies to once incurable diseases- that sounds like someone that you could easily use to cover up the real creator of those potions. However, with someone in the shadows like this, uncontrolled and providing a market of species changing items; how could the Neopian authorities not try to ease the public concerns by identifying a culprit, even if it is not them. </p><p>�����\"But,\" I hear you mutter again, \"who would want to do something like this?\"</p><p>�����There are many workings behind the scenes in Neopia. Having the public vilify Dr. Sloth is a way for them to further their own agendas. With discrediting and striking Dr. Sloth's successes from the record, other shops can inflate their own worth and make them look like the true heroes. Others can take credit and hike prices at will for technology that they did not put Neopoints into for research development. It all becomes pure profit for them. Then fame is an added bonus for them to manipulate innocent Neopians with. You see, the manipulators are the ones that create all this hostility towards the benevolent Dr. Sloth. They attempt to flip the script so that they are not seen as the ones pulling the strings. The true puppeteers would not have you know what they do or are capable of. So the scapegoat selected was Dr. Sloth. </p><p>�����So how will you know if you are part of the Minion Elite? </p><p>�����Simple. When you finally get your faithful moment with Dr. Sloth, it will usually be when you least expect it. Frolicking through Mystery Island, playing a few games of NeoQuest or Wingoball, perhaps spreading the word and teachings to prepare for the next invasion- This is when you will see a precarious event take place. An entourage of futuristically dressed individuals will approach you. You, perplexed, see the entourage split in the middle to make way for a towering individual. Well dress, handsomely green, and sporting a deviously pleasant smile. Dr. Sloth has approached you. </p><p>�����So you have been approached, but not so fast. This is where things get truly interesting. </p><p>�����You will then be informed of your great duty to the Neopian world. For we all know that the Honorable Dr. Sloth is the one whom keeps us safe at night. You stand there as \"his 'associates' take 20% of your Neopoints away to support his next Neopian invasion effort.\" Your hard earned Neopoints will be feeding the coffers and revolution of tomorrow, in the mighty hands of Sloth.</p><p>�����But what is this?</p><p>�����You realize as they disappear from sight, you have not been relieved of 20% of your hard earned Neopoints. In fact, you have been GIVEN 20% more than the Neopoints which you had on hand. You have been entrusted and funded to help bring about the true destiny of the Neopian world. To reveal the truth and distill the lies.</p><p>�����The message is clear. You are part of the Minion Elite. You must prepare for the next invasion. A day when Sloth will step back out of the shadows, for the glorious rise of Sloth.</p><p>�����So go forth and spread the words of Dr. Sloth. Let it be known that it is not him which you should fear. It is the ones who fabricate such lies about a noble man such as he. Ones that prey on the weaker Neopians in order to sit at their tables and have great feasts while some drink water to curb their hunger for they cannot afford bread. Rally the weak and let them know that they will be safe under the umbrella of Dr. Sloths personal body armour. If you are reading this and you have finally realized the truth, remember, Sloth needs you. </p>"

Those with a sense of humour are look forward to a visit from Boochi while others are quite unsure.

Regardless, you are baby.</p><p>����� Mostly Bs:</p><p>����� Punchbag Bob</p><p>����� You love nature and all things organic. Some see you as boring or without personality but the truth if you�re just a kind Neopian who is there for everyone. Like Punchbag Bob, you�ve got the friendliest smile and will happily play with everyone so everybody feels included.

Your alignment is true good, just like the Space Faerie who fought the extremely evil Dr. Sloth and won. You are very strong both mentally and physically and are well respected by common folk. She is so popular, in fact, that she is the mascot for Neopets Premium and is essentially a celebrity!</p><p>����� Now you know which iconic Battledome Challenger you are. Why not gather your best weapons and take your strongest pet to the Battledome and give them a challenge? Have fun and good luck! </p><p>����� </p>"

      "UN": ["hectic_haley"],
      "Desc": "So you want to celebrate Sloth Appreciation day but do not know how?",
      "Filename": "580150",
      "Piece": "<p>�����So you want to celebrate Sloth Appreciation day but do not know how? Let me give you a list of top foods to celebrate Dr. Sloth. Now I know what you are thinking� Sloth Appreciation Day is not a foodie holiday, which is fair. The Sloth themed foods around Neopia are few and far between, the edible ones even less so. I�ve sampled every Sloth dish around and can recommend you several options for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. You will not be eating the most exotic foods or even the fanciest foods, but I will guarantee that you will eat delicious food if you listen to my recommendations. </p><p>�����Breakfast</p><p>�����They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and it is hard to argue with that. Your breakfast sets the tone for your day. If you want to have a good start to Sloth Appreciation Day there are two dishes I would recommend. They are on the lighter side, as your lunch and dinner options will have more sustenance.</p><p>�����Though Sloth Appreciation Day is celebrated during the winter, I would recommend trying the Dr. Sloth Summer Fruit Salad. It�s a unique combination of strawberries, blueberries, and some mysterious Sloth shaped fruit. I wasn�t able to identify what the mysterious fruit was, but it was a strange combination of sweet and tangy. It was a little unsettling to eat fruit shaped like Sloth, but the unique flavor kept me hooked. There is one disclaimer that comes when eating this fruit salad and that is that Neopian domination is not included. If you�re looking or a way to take over Neopia, I�d suggest reading a different article.</p><p>�����The second breakfast item I would recommend is the Cherry Sloth Yogurt. You can pair this with the Dr. Sloth Summer Fruit Salad but it can also stand alone as a light breakfast item. If you had a hard time stomaching the Sloth shaped fruit, this might be a better option for you. The cherry yogurt is simply served in a dish that resembles Dr. Sloth�s head. The yogurt is impeccable and has an authentic cherry flavor. I was shocked to find out this food is a Space Food.</p><p>�����Lunch</p><p>�����I�m not a big lunch person myself, but you will definitely find me lunching on Sloth Appreciation Day. I was even able to find a vegetarian option for all the vegetarians out there in Neopia. These are two different options and even if you were hungry enough I am not sure I would recommend them together. However, to each their own. It�s your Sloth Appreciation Day, celebrate it how you want!</p><p>�����My personal favorite lunch item was the Sloth Day Nachos. I was told not to ask what was in it when I ordered it, which scared me. However, I found they tasted like ordinary nachos. There was an essence of sloth in it. The dish it�s served in looks like his robe and the green substance, which tasted like guacamole, reminded me of the man himself. The chips were crisp with the perfect ratio of salt. The tomatoes were the perfect size, and the portion size was ideal. I can�t certify this as vegetarian though, because no one could confirm its ingredients.</p><p>�����Now for the vegetarian option! This one was a bit tricky to track down. It�s a rare food, but I can confidently say it was worth the trouble to find. This is an exotic option. I can�t tell you what the wrap is. It�s black, it resembles his robe. It has the texture of an ordinary wrap, but there�s something in the taste that I just can�t put my finger on. You definitely need to be a bold eater to try this. It also comes in a non-vegetarian option if that is what floats your boat.</p><p>�����Dinner</p><p>�����If you still have room for food on this Sloth Appreciation day, you�re in for quite a surprise. Literally. One of the foods I am recommending is to say the least, something you have never tried before. But we�ll get into that in a bit. Both options are filling, but I ask that you leave some room for dessert!</p><p>�����For our less adventurous eaters, I would recommend enjoying the Plain Sloth Day Burger as a way to dedicate your dinner to Sloth. The word plain is a bit misleading. This is another meal that you can�t identify all the ingredients. There�s a bun, and a burger. There�s also some lettuce. However, there is an odd green sauce and I can tell you it�s not avocado. I can�t identify the taste, but it pairs nicely with the rest of the burger. It was also a dish created in honor of Sloth Appreciation Day, so what better day to try it on!</p><p>�����As you know, Space Food can be an acquired taste. It�s exotic, it�s often unidentifiable, but sometimes you find diamonds in the rough. The Sloth Surprise is one of those. The resemblance to SLoth is uncanny, who knows maybe it�s what Sloth tastes like. I can�t be sure. I can�t say anything about this dish. All I know is that if you�re bold enough, you should try it. Words simply cannot describe the experience of eating a Sloth Surprise.</p><p>�����Dessert</p><p>�����Dessert is arguably the best part of food. I know it was my favorite part of the research for this article. I sampled every dessert, and there was no bad one. Even the Sloth Cheese Cake was edible. However, to keep things consistent, I will give you my top two. If you want more, I would encourage you to go out and sample the other desserts!</p><p>�����If you want something a little different, I would suggest the Grape Sloth Cake. I know what you�re thinking �... a grape cake?� Yes, reader! A grape cake. It�s so sweet and dense. It looks like Kreludor with Sloth planting a flag at the top. The Sloth figurine is not edible, I tried. However, it makes for a great little toy to commemorate your Sloth Appreciation Day! This cake is so filling, but it is possible to eat the whole thing in one sitting.</p><p>�����If you are looking for something a little more traditional and not so filling, I would recommend the Sloth Cone. You�ve got to eat it quickly as it melts pretty fast and loses its Sloth form. There�s extra cone with this ice cream and it�s a delicious waffle cone! The ice cream itself tasted like pistachio to me, but I�ve heard others say it tastes like lime. Regardless, it was delicious and a great way to cap off Sloth Appreciation Day</p><p>����� </p>"

He�s coming soon!� Snaw ran around the house, broom in hand. </p><p>�����Sparkles adjusted two round cushions on the living room sofa. �Who�s coming again, Snaw?� asked the pink Bruce.</p><p>������It�s name is Greg, and he�s one of my closest friends and enemies!� Snaw jumped onto the table and started dancing. �He may not look great or knows how to style his hair, but he�s still okay. In fact, he�s so much fun to hate and play with!�</p><p>�����Scary rolled her eyes. �If he�s a friend of yours, then he�s automatically a freak,� the purple Bruce scoffed from the couch. �Just like that weirdo who introduced you to fire.� </p><p>������I like Miss Jenn,� said Sparkles, placing two coasters on the table after Snaw had jumped off. �Her fire blowing trick was so cool.�</p><p>������<i>All</i> of Snaw's friends are freaks,� Scary declared, �and this new one�s probably one of the worst.� </p><p>�����The doorbell rang, and with Snaw busy dancing around the living room, Sparkles left to answer it. When she returned, Greg was standing behind her, and Snaw immediately ran towards him. �GREG!!� Snaw hugged his friend close before pushing him back. �I see you didn�t bring those lemon squares you said you�d bring. What an unbelievable liar you are!�</p><p>�����Greg chuckled. �It�s nice to see you too, Snaw. So, are these two Sprinkles and Scarlet?�</p><p>������I dunno.� Snaw went back on the table. </p><p>������And where are the other two?� asked Greg, looking around.</p><p>������Unfortunately, they won�t be able to join us today,� said Sparkles. �But do take a seat, and I�ll get refreshments.� </p><p>�����After Greg finished his half cookie�Snaw had taken the other half, believing Greg was plotting to steal all the cookies for nefarious deeds�the four-some began a lively game of charades. Things quickly became awkward, though, when Greg struggled to guess what Snaw was doing. �Uh, are you falling from the sky?� he asked, watching Snaw wave his arms while jumping. �Or are you some type of Pteri?�</p><p>�����Scary groaned and slid down from the sofa. �That idiot's been jumping for ten minutes!! Can�t anybody hurry up and end this agony already??�</p><p>�����Snaw stopped and threw a coaster at Greg. �You�re a terrible guesser, Greg! Just like I thought you'd be!�</p><p>������Then what were you supposed to be?� asked Greg, snickering.</p><p>������Obviously, I was an Emerald Queen Usuki exploring the Faerieland woods,� Snaw explained matter-of-factly. �Mess up again GREG and I shall throw more things at you!� </p><p>�����Things became even more awkward when Snaw cut the game short to roll on the ground, proclaiming, �I AM THE MAGICAL SNAW!�</p><p>�����Scary facepalmed. �Will this torture ever end?� </p><p>������Greg, would you like more juice?� asked Sparkles, straining to smile as she picked up the jug. After setting the jug back down, she turned and saw Snaw was now skipping around the living room. �Well ...at least somebody's having fun.� </p><p>�����Snaw stopped skipping. �Oh! I need to go get the dinner stuff.� </p><p>������I thought you got the groceries earlier,� said Sparkles. �Didn't you go to the Bazaar today?�</p><p>������What I do during the day is not the concern of any possible spies!� With a huff, Snaw headed to the front door. �I�ll be off, dear strangers. While I�m gone, be certain Greg doesn't receive any more nourishment. He shall pay for what he did three months and five years ago in a place I don�t know!� Grabbing his purse from a hook, Snaw slammed the door shut.</p><p>����� ����Scary rolled her eyes. �<i>Finally</i> that disgrace decided to leave,� she snorted. �Now to hope Snaw will never return.� </p><p>������I�m surprised Snaw has a purse,� said Greg, smirking. </p><p>������Snaw says purses make good defense weapons,� Sparkles explained.</p><p>�����Greg chuckled. �Yeah, that definitely sounds like something Snaw would say.� He looked at Sparkles and Scary. �So, uh, which one�s �Sprinkles� and �Scarlet�?�</p><p>������Wrong house, n00b.� Scary groaned and threw a cushion at Greg. �Why must that moronic Snaw <i>always</i> invite his equally idiotic friends over? I have better things to do than hang around here with a bunch of freaks!�</p><p>������I loved hosting Jenn. She was so much fun,� said Sparkles.</p><p>�����Greg burst out laughing. �It�s no wonder Snaw�s so crazy about wanting to set my house on fire: Jenn was probably the one to provoke him with the idea!�</p><p>�����After Greg was done laughing, the three-some sat in an awkward silence once again. Sparkles refilled the jug. Scary, fed up with everything, left the room and headed upstairs. Greg admired the baton hanging over the fireplace and smiled. Minutes later Sparkles and Greg sat back down, Sparkles feeling even more uncomfortable in the quiet. �So ...um, how did you and Snaw meet?� she asked hesitantly.</p><p>������We met through our mutual friends Zia and Brett,� Greg explained. He looked amused. �From the minute we met, Snaw was already screaming at me one minute and then inviting me to tea in the next. I was told this was normal and that Snaw didn�t have any known biting-related habits.�</p><p>�����Sparkles facepalmed. �Oh no. I must apologize for ...uh, whatever that is.�</p><p>������Yeah, I know Snaw�s not much of a biter,� said Greg. �Though he does like screaming, especially if it�s at me. Then again, Snaw has always been very expressive with his emotions.� </p><p>�����Sparkles agreed, pleased they agreed on something. �I must also apologize for how the evening�s been going so far, though. Snaw can be a bit ...uh, ecstatic at times for sure. But he�s been looking forward to your visit all week, and I�m sure he�s trying his best to entertain you.�</p><p>������Oh yeah, I know Snaw�s trying.� Greg laughed out loud. �He�s definitely a bit cuckoo and threatening at times, but I tend to just laugh it off and �go with the flow�, as Snaw would say if he was ever familiar with this saying. Still a little strange, though.�</p><p>�����Sparkles beamed. She didn�t want to express how grateful she was for Greg�s consideration and understanding of her over-the-top owner. If Greg was willing to continue being patient with Snaw, Sparkles was certain they would be lifelong friends�that is, if Greg was serious about his feelings about their friendship.</p><p>�����A few minutes later, Snaw burst through the front door with two full bags. �You would not believe it: the Grooming Parlour was having a humongous sale! Lucky for me, since I was out of all the creams I need to maintain my perfect appearance. I also ran into Hanna at the Bazaar, so she�s joining us for food!�</p><p>�����Hanna waved at Greg. �We got you face cream! Snaw says you need it.� She turned to beam at Sparkles, who happily waved back.</p><p>������Great. Thanks Snaw,� said Greg, chuckling. �But what about dinner? Couldn�t find the Food Shop again?�</p><p>������Puh-lease Greg, like I�d ever buy food for <i>you</i>,� scoffed Snaw, rummaging through a bag. He pulled up a red hairbrush and handed it to Greg. �Since you�re hair is always the definition of ugly, I think you should keep it.�</p><p>�����Greg smirked. �Oh Snaw, you�re such a kidder. As always.�</p><p>������Don�t mock me, GREG! You don�t have the right!� gasped Snaw.</p><p>������Now Snaw, try to keep calm and think about plushies and fancy clothes,� Hanna said encouragingly. </p><p>�����Sparkles watched as Snaw continued shouting at Greg for random reasons. Hanna was trying to fuse the situation and was able to prevent Snaw from throwing a vase at Greg. Greg remained calm and acted as if this was all routine, and nothing serious was going to happen the longer the continued to spat. It was an odd exchange, but Sparkles was pleased when Greg offered to go out and get food for everyone. �Do you still like pepperoni on your pizza, Snaw?� he asked.</p><p>�����Snaw beamed. \"Ooh, I love exotic foods! You're such a kind Neopian Greg, and I'm so lucky to have you as a best friend forever!\"</p><p>�����\"How sweet!\" Hanna squished her friends. \"I'll make some lemonade for us. Sparkles, would you go set the table?\"</p><p>�����Sparkles nodded. She hoped the rest of the night would remain as calm once Greg came back with food, but she wasn�t sure. At with Hanna around, there may not be anything too dramatic going on, no matter how Snaw tried to add excitement or random shouting. She smiled, remembering what Greg said about going with the flow in such chaotic situations. If Greg was going to survive this crazy visit, then so would Sparkles; even if meant just sitting back and watching all the chaos unfold. </p><p>�����<b>The end. </b></p>"

      "Piece": "<p>�����<font size=5>I</font>t was Noah�s birthday and the little baby Chomby could hardly wait for his friends to turn up at his birthday party which was going to be at Roo Island, where he currently is. Noah waited patiently and alone near the Merry-go-round for his guests to turn up. He planned for them to go on the Merry-go-round several times then spend the rest of the day at Roo Island beach then have cake at his Neolodge Room. His best friend, Charismee wanted to help gather all the food, drinks and presents. Noah�s Petpet, Oscar the Searex wasn�t with him, instead, he was with Twumbo, one of Noah�s great friends, shopping for a gift. </p><p>������I wonder who will be the first to turn up,� Noah said to himself, oblivious that a Yellow Blumaroo wearing a red and white striped shirt was nearby listening to him. </p><p>������That's a good question, you sound like you have a lot of friends coming for your party. Why don�t you have a turn on the Merry-go-round while you wait for them?� The Yellow Blumaroo suggested, overhearing what he said. </p><p>������I�m tempted to, but I think it wouldn�t be fair if I did that. I do have a lot coming. Oh, here�s Edimira and she looks like she�s got her arms full� Noah said then excitedly ran up to the Faerie Xweetok who held several different gift bags in her hands. Her Petpet, Magic and Petpetpet, Ire were with her sitting on her shoulder. The Yellow Blumaroo wished he could help the Xweetok but knew he had to stay at his spot with the Merry-go-round. </p><p>������Hi Edimira! Need a hand?� Noah said.</p><p>������Hi Noah! Happy Birthday and I got you a lot of presents and no thank you, I'll put the bags down here. Tyzlant and all the others are coming shortly� Edimira answered as she put the gift bags down on the ground. Magic and Ire wished him a Happy Birthday too.</p><p>������Thank you so much, Edimira, Magic and Ire! I�m looking forward to see the others too. Oscar�s with Charismee at the moment and they should be back shortly� Noah said.</p><p>�����Edimira smiled and looked at the Merry-go-round, she watched as several Neopets got on it then turned her attention back to Noah. �Should we go on the merry-go-round while we wait?� she asked. </p><p>������Not yet, I want to wait until the others get here and then we all can have several turns before heading to the beach. Hey look, Tyzlant, Acuarina, Oira, Xandra and Lilian are coming� Noah said excitedly noticing the five Neopets had several gift bags in their hands too. Noah rushed off to greet the five, Edimira looked after the gift bags she had given Noah just in case a sticky thief was hanging around. </p><p>������Happy Birthday, Noah!� Tyzlant, Lilian, Xandra, Acuarina and Oira cried out excitedly to the baby Chomby. </p><p>������Thank you so much! Would you like a hand with all of those?� Noah said smiling. </p><p>������No, we�re fine! It�s your birthday so you just get to relax and have fun with all of us. I saw Waltan, Charismee, Twumbo and Jossee a while ago, so they should be here soon� Lilian said smiling to Noah as she put the gift bags down near where Edimira did. Xandra, Tyzlant, Oira and Acuarina put their gift bags there too. </p><p>�����Noah excitedly began chatting to his friends while they waited for Waltan, Charismee, Twumbo and Jossee, who came just as they got into an exciting conversation. </p><p>������Happy Birthday, Noah!� Waltan, Charismee, Twumbo and Jossee exclaimed excitedly as they put their gift bags near where the others had done. Oscar quickly went to Noah�s side and hugged him, Noah returned his hug. Bonia, Adusen, Levinna and Zaph all turned up at the same time too, with gift bags in their hands, which they quickly put in the same pile and wished Noah a happy birthday. Noah thanked them. </p><p>������Thank you so much. Blossum, Bubbles, Buttercup, Jelifisch and Midnight are nearly here too, I can see them!� Noah said to his friends. He could hardly contain his excitement. Like the others, they were holding gift bags in their hands too!</p><p>������Happy Birthday, Noah� Jelifisch said, as she put the gift bags with Edimira�s ones. Blossum, Bubbles, Buttercup and Midnight did the same and wished him a happy birthday too.</p><p>������Thank you so much, everyone! I�m so happy that everyone�s turning up, I can see Darkness, StarrysAngel, Alariona, Queenie and Ru too! That�s everyone� Noah said. Sure, enough the five Neopets that he had mentioned walked up to him with gift bags in their hands. </p><p>������Happy Birthday, Noah� Queenie said, smiling as she gave him her gift bag. Darkness, StarrysAngel, Alariona and Ru wished him a happy birthday too. </p><p>�����Soon the twenty-five Neopets began chatting away excitedly to one another, along with their Petpets and Petpetpets.</p><p>������Let�s go on the merry-go-round!� Noah said smiling to Xandra who nodded in agreement. She had secretly always wanted to go on one. </p><p>�����Noah felt so lucky to have so many amazing friends to be with him that day. The Neopets joined the queue at the Merry-go-round, their Petpets and Petpetpets decided to keep an eye out on the gift bags to ensure no sticky thieves were about.</p><p>�����Noah counted eleven Uni�s on the Merry-go-round while he watched the current Neopets on the ride. �Since there�s eleven of them, we�ll have to choose who gets to go first� Noah said to Lilian who was next to him.</p><p>������That�s fine with me, let�s see. After me there are Ru, Queenie, Darkness, StarrysAngel, Tyzlant, Edimira, Oira, Alariona and Blossum� Lilian said looking at the line of Neopets behind her smiling to know that they are within the group. </p><p>������Alright that�s easy then, the eleven of us can go first and the others can go after, then there will be three that have to go with other pets� Noah said smiling. Lilian nodded; she was happy with Noah�s decision. When the current Neopets got off the merry-go-round, some stumbled, for they felt dizzy after going on it! </p><p>������I knew I shouldn�t have eaten� mumbled a Yellow Chia who walked past Noah. </p><p>������That poor Chia! I�m sure he�ll be fine after a while, well it�s our turn. I�m so excited� Lilian said smiling as she watched the Yellow Blumaroo signal for the Neopets to get on. Each pet paid their 50 NeoPoints for the ride. Soon eleven Neopets were on the merry-go-round which went around several times as Noah wished for it to do. When it stopped, he and the other pets were dizzy and stumbled as they got off their Uni�s. </p><p>������I�m so dizzy� Ru said, as he swayed to and fro while he walked. �I can see double of everything� he added. </p><p>������I�m the same� Queenie agreed with a giggle. The others nodded in agreement. </p><p>������That was so much fun though, now it�s the others turn� Noah said watching as Waltan, Twumbo, Charismee, Jossee, Buttercup, Bubbles, Jelifisch, Xandra, Bonia, Zaph and Levinna went on afterwards. Noah sat down near the gift bags and watched as the rest of his friends had their turns on the merry-go-round, like him, they become dizzy when they got off. Once everyone had their turn on the ride, they sat down and talked to Noah excitedly. </p><p>������How are you enjoying your day?� Zaph asked smiling to the Chomby.</p><p>������I�m loving every minute of it, honestly. I don�t want it to end� Noah said. �I�m so glad everyone could make it� he added smiling to Zaph. He looked at all of his friends then at the bags. </p><p>������Should we go to my place then the beach or to the beach then mine?� Noah asked, thinking it would be so much of a hassle to carry all the bags to the beach then back at his. </p><p>������Good question. I got your cakes and we could have it at the beach or at yours� Charismee said, she had bought several Spiral Faellie Cakes hoping that will be enough for everyone. </p><p>������Wouldn�t it be better to take the bags to Noah�s Neolodge room first then head back to the beach?� Blossum suggested. </p><p>�����Jelifisch nodded, agreeing with Blossom�s suggestion, everyone else agreed. Noah liked that idea too, though he had originally planned to go to his place last, but seeing the amount of gift bags made him change his mind.</p><p>������Alright, we�ll head back to mine and have the cake and lunch there and finish the day at Roo Island Beach� Noah said smiling. The group of Neopets, Petpets and Petpetpets made their way to Noah�s Neolodge room which was number 78, lucky for him it was big enough to have everyone in it. They had cake and random sandwich�s for lunch, along with jellies and Neocola for drinks. After they had lunch and the cake, Noah opened all of his presents, thanking his friends for their gifts. They soon made their way to Roo Island beach and played Volley Ball until sunset, that was when Noah decided to close the party, he was feeling tired but happy and noticed everyone else was too. </p><p>������Thank you for inviting me to your party, Noah, I had a great time. I�ll invite you to mine when it comes� Bonia said with a smile. </p><p>������You�re welcome, Bonia and everyone else. Thank you all for coming along, it was the best party I�ve ever had� Noah said. He hugged everyone as they left and soon it was just him and Oscar. </p><p>�����Noah and Oscar made their way back to the Neolodge to tidy up. �What an awesome day, hello, what�s this?� Noah said in surprise. He found a Skidget crawling across the carpet in his room and tried catching it, but it slipped away. �Oscar, I think you and I have a new friend that may be joining us soon� Noah said. </p><p>������He is so cute, if he wants to join us, I�d love to look after him. I would call him Sky� Oscar said, imagining all of the adventures the three could have together. Oscar attempted to catch the Skidget which somehow managed to get away. It was clear the little Petpetpet was shy and it was a gift from one of Noah�s friends. Noah planned to befriend the Petpetpet. �I�ll leave a Half-Bitten Apple out for Sky tonight and we�ll see if he�ll be interested in joining us next time� Noah said and took a Half-Bitten Apple out of a gift bag and placed it on his Elegant Table. </p><p>������I wonder if Sky will join us� Oscar said sounding hopeful. �I guess we�ll find out another time, good night, Noah, I�m going to bed now, sleep well� Oscar added as he made his way to his Lost Desert Fancy Petpet Bed. </p><p>�����Noah let out a yawn and climbed into his Pastel Cot. �Good night, Oscar, sleep well, and see you tomorrow, we�ll check on Sky too� Noah said. He snuggled under his blankets and thought about the events that day, he loved seeing all of his friends with him at his birthday and planned to invite them again for next year�s one. He hoped that Sky the Skidget would be able to join them too, however, only time will tell if Sky will join them. </p><p>�����Noah closed his eyes and soon fell asleep, dreaming about the merry-go-round. Oscar too soon fell asleep, dreaming about the wonderful birthday that Noah had and becoming friends with the Skidget.</p><p>�����<b>The End.</b></p><p><b>����� ���� </b></p><p><b>����� </b></p>"

      "Filename": "580078",
      "Piece": "<p>�����<font size=5>S</font>carlet tacked up the newest postcard she�d received from her sister and brother on the wall. This one was from Shenkuu. Dred and Forest traveled all over the world. The only place the starry xweetok had ever been was the Haunted Woods, Terror Mountain, and the ruins of Geraptiku, but they didn�t really count, and she wasn�t really allowed there. </p><p>����� Her mother was always warning her to stay away from there, but she couldn�t help herself. There was so much for her to explore, especially the old tomb. She�d found all the traps, and even made friend with the ghost hissi that haunted it. Unfortunately, Geraptiku had few secrets for her to learn. </p><p>����� She sighed as she laid on her bed, looking at the various postcards that now covered her walls. Each one described the fabulous cuisine for Steel, the art for Tenz, the plants for Bandy, the various machinery for Jungle, travel for Kookie, and for Scarlet there was the always information about who discovered the land and what the terrain was like. She knew it was a weird question and all her brother and sisters� requests made sense, but it was what she was interested in. At least they always let her keep the postcards to hang on her wall after everyone got to read them of course. </p><p>����� Forest and Dred were the first ones in the family to leave the island other than their mom, who regularly visited Neopia Central. No one else seemed interested, they were all perfectly content to stay on the island. So why wasn�t she content here?</p><p>����� �There�s a new postcard from Forest and Dred!� She sat up quickly almost falling off the bed. There was new card already? The last one arrived only two days ago. Scarlet slid off her bed and slid across the floor to her door, grabbing her plushie Anubis as went out the door. </p><p>����� �Woah,� </p><p>����� �Dred?!� Scarlet crashed into her maraquan eyrie older brother as she slid off the end of the banister, knocking him to the floor. �but mom said-?� </p><p>����� �Oof, what has Steel been feeding you,� Dred asked, laughing, as she climbed off him, and pulled him to his feet. </p><p>����� �Forest!� She threw herself at her sister Forest who stood in the doorway. The mutant aisha caught her just in time and managed to keep her balance. </p><p>����� �Well hi Scarlet, missed us huh?� She laughed, as the others came down the stairs to similarly greeted their home come siblings. </p><p>����� ---</p><p>����� �That was great Steel, really,� Dred patted his stomach as he complimented his older brother. The darigan poogle smiled as he cleared the table. Steel was the oldest of in the family, and the best cook.</p><p>����� �Not to exotic for you?� Steel teased. �We�ve really enjoyed the recipes you�ve sent us. Some of the ingredients have been hard to find, but mom is great at finding deals at the marketplace. I thought you might enjoy some island food though after all those months at sea and traveling the world.�</p><p>����� �Tell me more about the flying ships!� Jungle begged. The young meerca was an inventor. Despite being the youngest of the 8 siblings, she was by far the smartest. �I bet if I got the right materials, I could build one.� </p><p>����� �I�m sorry, Jungle,� Forest laughed. �but I honestly didn�t spend much time studying the mechanics of them. That was supposed to be Dred�s job, but he was too busy stuffing himself at the exotic foods store. They have some very strange but interesting dishes there. We are quite partial to them. You�d like it there Kookie, being able to fly is a big advantage being so high in the mountains.�</p><p>����� Scarlet listened for a few minutes longer before getting up to help Steel bring the dishes into the kitchen. She could hear Dred and Forest sharing more details of their latest trip in the dining room. She sighed as she put the dishes beside the sink. </p><p>����� �What�s the matter?� Steel asked as he turned on the faucet. </p><p>����� �Huh? What? Nothing, why would anything be the matter? Dred and Forest are home,� Scarlet replied. �There is nothing the matter.�</p><p>����� �Really,� Steel asked one eyebrow raised. �You know I�d almost believe you if you didn�t say nothing seven times.�</p><p>����� �I only said nothing twice,� Scarlet defended as Dred came into the room.</p><p>����� �What no-Am I interrupting?� Dred asked suspiciously. Looking at his two siblings. Steel�s arms were crossed, and he was leaning against the counter. Scarlet had her arms behind her back, but her tail was swishing, giving away her true feelings. </p><p>����� �No,� She denied.</p><p>����� �Right,� Steel said again as he opened the fridge. He pulled out two pies. �I even made you and Forest�s favorite disgusting seaweed pie when you are done getting the truth out of Scarlet.� </p><p>����� �There is nothing to get out of me!� She denied again, trying to follow him out of the kitchen but Dred blocked her path. </p><p>����� �Spill little sister,� Dred said, pushing her toward a chair. �What is this all about?� </p><p>����� �There is nothing to spill,� She denied again. Dred sat down across from her with his arms crossed and waited. �Okay, okay, I-I just want, I want to go with you and Forest when you leave!� She covered her mouth as soon as she finished saying it. Dred laughed and moved her paw away from her mouth with his own. </p><p>����� �Why would you want to hide that?� Dred asked. </p><p>����� �Because if mom and the others found out I wanted to leave they�d be crushed,� She said looking down at the table, ashamed. </p><p>����� �Well it's not like you won�t ever come back, Forest and I do all the time,� Dred told her putting one paw on her shoulder. �Sure everyone was sad when we left, I know you were, but it makes up happy. Forest has never been happier, and that�s what you want for us isn�t it?� </p><p>����� �Well of course, I want you guys to be happy!� Scarlet replied. </p><p>����� �Then why wouldn�t we want you to be happy?� Dred replied. �Besides if you don�t like its not like you can�t come home.� </p><p>����� �I guess not.� </p><p>����� ---</p><p>����� �Don�t forget to wash behind your ears, and brush your teeth, and don�t- �</p><p>����� �Mom, I won�t,� Scarlet protested, wiggling out her hug. If she started crying, then Scarlet would to. �I�m just riding with them to Krawk Island, then coming home.�</p><p>����� �I know I just, aw, I�m going to miss you!�</p><p>����� �Don�t worry, mom, we�ll take good care of her,� Dred promised hugging their mom. Forest hugged her too, before wrapping one arm around Scarlet. </p><p>����� �Come on, we�d better get going the longer we take the harder it will be,� Forest murmured to her sister. Scarlet nodded in agreement. Their mom was never good with long goodbyes. �Dred, cast off.� </p><p>�����---</p><p>����� It took a little while to get used to the swaying of the ship, but her sea legs came quickly. Dred showed her the crow�s nest and their faerie pteri figure head. He even let her climb out on it with his telescope. Forest let her stay in her cabin and the galley.</p><p>����� When they were to busy to show her around Scarlet explored the ship herself. Soon she knew the small ship as well as her siblings and been nipped numerous times by the various cofferlings that lived in her sister�s ship. She�d made friends with all but her sister�s favorite, who at least had stopped biting her, but it did spit at her occasionally. By the time they reached Krawk Island Scarlet felt like a bon a fide pirate.</p><p>����� She began to dress like one, talk like one, and she felt like one. Scarlet felt like maybe she�d found what she wanted to do for the rest of her life, until they landed on Krawk Island.</p><p>����� ---</p><p>����� �Did you know there was smugglers cove?� Scarlet giggled conspiratorially to Forest and Dred one night when she met them at the Golden Dubloon for dinner one night. </p><p>����� �Yes we did,� Derd confirmed with a smile. He waved for a waitress to come to their table. Forest exchanged a look with their brother. </p><p>����� �What other trouble have you gotten into?� Forest asked.</p><p>����� �Not much, but I can�t go to the Swashbuckler�s Academy any more, I�ve trained out of it,� She answered. �I�ve seen the whole island��</p><p>����� �Yes it sounds like it,� Dred replied as the wocky waitress arrived at their table. �Three Thornberry Fruit Grog, two seaweed pie and Scarlet? Scarlet?�</p><p>����� �Scarlet, what do you want to eat?� Forest snapped her fingers in front of her sister�s face. Scarlet was staring out the window.</p><p>����� �Oh, um, sorry, sea taco please,� She replied shaking her head. The waitress nodded and left the table. </p><p>����� �Alright, what�s on your mind?� Dred asked. </p><p>����� �How do you and Steel always do that,� Scarlet protested. Forest silently pointed to her sister's tail that was sweeping a nice pile of dust on either side of her on the floor. </p><p>����� �Oh,� She shrugged sheepishly. �I just, well, I�ve seen almost everything on the island.� She traced the shape of the island on the tabletop. </p><p>����� �Yes, and?� Dred prompted. </p><p>����� �And I, I want to see more,� Scarlet answered. �And-I, I want to share it too! I wish I had some paper, I�d draw it all for you. I know where everything is. I know all the beaches like the back of my own paw. I could draw Mystery Island too.� </p><p>����� �I bet you could,� Forest replied, with a smile. �So why don�t you?� </p><p>����� �Why don�t I what?� Scarlet asked, looking up confused.</p><p>����� �Well, where do you think maps come from, someone has to make them,� Dred answered, pulling out one he had in his pocket to show her. She looked it over. It was Krawk Island alright, but it wasn�t as detailed as she would have done. The beaches weren�t very detailed, and key was lacking some very important details. </p><p>����� �Yeah, but I�ve only been few places, I don�t think that�d take me very long�� She frowned. </p><p>����� �No, it wouldn�t but it would certainly take you longer if you explored other places,� Forest suggested. </p><p>����� �Other places?� Scarlet asked.</p><p>����� �Yes, other places, like Shenkuu or Altador,� Dred suggested. </p><p>����� �But what about mom?� Scarlet protested. </p><p>����� �What about mom?� Forest asked. �Mom wants you to be happy.� </p><p>����� �Yeah,� Scarlet replied thoughtfully. �But I should finish the maps I can make first, when I get home.�</p><p>����� �Of course,� Dred agreed, but they both knew that this wouldn�t be Scarlet�s last adventure. She was going to be the greatest adventurer since Brucey B!</p><p>����� ���� <b>The End. </b></p>"

      "Piece": "<p>�����<font size=5>E</font>rin was trying very hard not to appear nervous, despite the difficult-to-ignore reality that her plan was unraveling at the seams. Reba stood next to her, and Orlitz was between them, restrained by some rope Erin had found in the carousel�s maintenance panel. They were back on the ferris wheel platform, and the machine spun solemnly behind them. Erin absently followed the rotation of the ride�s gondolas. Once upon a time, this had been her favorite attraction to ride on with her grandfather. They had spent countless afternoons inside these multicolored closed cabins, often to have lunch with a view of the entire park.</p><p>�����Reba turned to her and asked what they should do next.</p><p>�����Well, what could they do next? Orlitz had caught Erin red-handed. Iskeen had escaped. The ixi was probably sounding the alarm right now. The Pink acara produced a shaky breath and rubbed her temples: she just needed time to think, but time was running out. She considered her prospects of a future once this night was over.</p><p>�����Erin had spent her childhood in Brightville, when her grandfather had been her only living relative. They had shared a close bond: Emnor Miranelis had dedicated much of his time showing Erin the secrets of his amusement park. By the time Erin turned ten, she knew Brightville�s layout like the back of her hand. She had unearthed its every hidden alcove and secret passage. She had spent hours playing in the underground tunnels or reading in the shade of the massive oak trees. </p><p>�����But Emnor left her when she was only eleven, and Erin was sent to a boarding school in Krawk Island. She remained there until she found a position as a local reporter for a small newspaper on the archipelago. It wouldn�t be long before the young acara was hired at the Neopian Times offices on Mystery Island. Away from the home she had known, thoughts of Brightville receded from her mind; memories of its tunnels and its enchanting attractions took on a dream-like gloss, and it seemed as though the park would fade away as a permanent facet of her past. That is, until the news of its imminent demolition reached her. </p><p>�����That night, when Erin had returned to her lonely apartment, she had remembered a small box in the back of her closet, filled with dusty Brightville mementos. Perhaps she had wanted to reminisce, perhaps she had wanted to mourn�whatever her motivation, Erin had found herself opening the box for the first time since it had been packed. She sat through the night, sometimes chuckling�often crying�at the multitude of photographs, drawings, and figurines that she discovered as if for the first time. When she flipped through the photo album at the bottom of the box, a sealed envelope had slipped out from its pages. It was a letter addressed to her:</p><p>�����Dearest Erin,</p><p>�����I fear the time I have left with you is running out, and soon I will leave you. You have grown up with Brightville, and it is true that a great part of my park lives in my heart. I am certain that it lives in your heart as well. That is why I want you to have Brightville when I am gone. You alone know its secrets. You understand its very soul. I believe that Brightville will continue to shine as the jewel of Brightvale with you at the helm. </p><p>�����Yours forever,</p><p>�����Emnor Miranelis</p><p>�����Erin had sat in the darkness of her apartment for a long while. What a twist of dramatic irony it should be that she only discover her rightful inheritance once the park was already doomed. But perhaps she could still save it� </p><p>�����What followed were several months of careful research as Erin unearthed Brightville�s decline after Emnor�s passing. She discovered that following a line of successors, Sophia Grigsby had eventually taken over and had failed to maintain the park�s attractions. She shared a correspondence with Reba Watt, one of the park�s longest-employed workers. She even attempted to contact Sophia herself to explain her situation, but the owner had been unreceptive. It wasn�t until she was assigned to write an article on Brightville with Orlitz Livia that she had begun to formulate a plan. If she could devise a scheme to stall the demolition, she might have a chance to reclaim the park as well.</p><p>�����Staging her own kidnapping had been easy enough. Reba only had to lead Lou Elder away from the welcome center on the assumption that the Neopian Times had cancelled the interview. Once she�d slipped into the building, Reba would be waiting for her in the dressing room, holding the trapdoor open. Erin would scream before disappearing into the tunnels. Everything had gone according to plan (except for a clothing rack standing unceremoniously in the way of her trajectory). No matter: clues were planted, Erin was hidden. All the was left was for the Brightvale Guard to begin investigating. </p><p>�����Only, Erin had not accounted for Orlitz�s skepticism, and she had not accounted for Reba�s vendetta. Letting the gnorbu in on her plan had been a mistake from the start. When they realized that more evidence should be planted to motivate the investigation, Reba had suggested they use Sophia as a scapegoat. Erin had reluctantly agreed: after all, with the owner out of the way, it would be easier to reclaim the park. But the more Orlitz grew suspicious, the more Reba panicked. She had insisted they plant more falsified evidence to maintain that Erin was trapped in the park. </p><p>�����Their staged event in the lost and found could have been executed without a hitch, but at the very last minute, Reba had insisted they leave a pizza behind to imply Erin had been in the park overnight. Erin had been livid at this spontaneous change of plans, and for good reason: the pizza would alert anyone that evidence had been deliberately planted. And the longer Reba and Erin collaborated, the more the former became volatile and anxious. Erin never intended for Orlitz to be injured in the haunted house, she only hoped the cybunny would discover the planted evidence and her second ransom note. Reba, however, had worried they�d be discovered, and in a burst of panic, had hit the cybunny upside the head. Then, of course, Sophia Grigsby and Nora Sparks had felt compelled to commence their own search of the park, sending Reba into another tirade, this time by directly threatening Sophia. </p><p>�����All this to say, Erin was very tired and wished this scheme would finally draw to a close. </p><p>������Erin, I�ll ask you again, what is the plan?� Erin blinked and let her gaze rest on Orlitz, who seemed perfectly calm in her bindings. </p><p>������I� I�m not sure,� she said.</p><p>������What do you mean you�re not sure?� Reba growled. There was something dangerous in her tone�Erin stiffened.</p><p>������I mean, what�s left to do? Iskeen is probably on her way back with the Brightvale Guard, so we�d better get out of here before they find us.�</p><p>������And give up everything we�ve worked on? I won�t let you do that.�</p><p>������She�s right you know,� Orlitz muttered from the floor, �you�re finished. You�ve been found out. By now, everyone will know the kidnapping was faked, and demolition will go on as scheduled.�</p><p>�����Erin exhaled. She hadn�t noticed she was holding her breath. �Let�s stop this now, Reba. We can just explain the entire situation to the guards, and I�m sure they�ll understand. Maybe it�s time we let Brightville go.� </p><p>�����The gnorbu clenched her jaw. Her eyes fixed themselves on Erin and the acara involuntarily took a step back. �Maybe you�re willing to turn yourself in, but I�ve been waiting for this for too long, and I�m not gonna let some bratty kid stop me. You�re either in it to the end, or you�re out.�</p><p>�����Erin opened her mouth to speak, but the right words wouldn�t come. Reba glowered at her.</p><p>������Guess you�re out.�</p><p>�����Before Erin could react, the gnorbu grabbed hold of her arm and dragged her towards the rotating gondolas on the ferris wheel. Erin was thrown into the moving compartment, followed by Orlitz. Reba slammed the gondola�s door shut and fastened its security lock. By the time Erin could find her footing, they had already ascended a quarter of the way to the top. </p><p>������Reba, stop this!� she cried out, but her voice would not reach the ground through the thick glass, and anyways, Reba would not have honored her request. Once the gondola had reached its apex, the ride abruptly came to a halt. The compartment swung violently, suspended in the air. Then, the entire wheel went dark. </p><p>�����* * * * * </p><p>�����Iskeen wasn�t exactly sure how she managed it, but she eventually fumbled her way back to the celebration. She knew she was back in the thick of the part because she collided with a cluster of party guests in line for carnival popcorn. She needed to find someone of rank and tell them what had transpired. Instead, someone of rank found her: </p><p>�����Iskeen felt a tap on her shoulder and spun around. Sophia stood before her, glittery dress and all, and she did not seem as happy to see Iskeen as Iskeen was to see her. </p><p>������You again? I thought I made it clear that I didn�t want you traipsing around my park again�how did you even get in here? Where�s Orlitz?� </p><p>������We found Erin, she was with Reba, but then Reba caught us and I managed to get away,� Iskeen sputtered, �I came back to find you or�or anyone for help!�</p><p>������So, Erin is alright then?�</p><p>������We suspected she faked her kidnapping and we just confirmed it.� </p><p>�����Sophia�s gaze hardened; she was mulling something over. �Well, I�m glad no one is in danger. If that�s the case, we will wait until this party is over and then we will finish this whole business.�</p><p>�����Iskeen struggled for words. Orlitz was still out there! Reba had a dangerous streak: who knows what she and Erin could have done to the cybunny to ensure her silence. �But Orlitz is in danger,� she protested.</p><p>������Orlitz is obviously very adaptable. I promise we will find her, as well as Erin and Reba, but we will do so after this celebration. I can�t afford to have it interrupted by��</p><p>������Oh come on!� Iskeen exclaimed, �we both know you�re just going to find Nora Sparks first chance you get so that both of you can stop Reba and break the story first.� The chomby stiffened.</p><p>������Watch your tone,� she warned. �I think you�ve had enough excitement for one evening. I don�t need you causing a </p><p>�����scene at my event, and it looks like you don�t even have an invitation with you. Guards!� </p><p>�����* * * * * </p><p>�����Orlitz stretched her fingers, willing her circulation to flow back into them once the ropes constricting her wrists had been loosened by Erin. Looking out the gondola, the cybunny could see only a small section of the amusement park aglow with light. Festivities were still taking place. Perhaps there would be fireworks later in the evening. Perhaps being trapped atop a ferris wheel would afford her a nice view of the light show. </p><p>�����In any event, this current situation was not ideal. The gondola left them wanting: it was furnished with two simple benches on opposite ends, and three out of its four walls were made of glass. Erin was curled onto a bench, opposite Orlitz. If she was frightened, she did not willingly show it. She fidgeted with her hair and gazed absently out of the window. </p><p>������How did you figure it out?�</p><p>������Believe me, I didn�t for a long time,� Orlitz sighed, �At first I thought you were being held hostage in the park, and once I found you in the lost and found with that pizza, I suspected you weren�t being kept inside the park at all. Then I discovered you had a familial connection to Brightville, and my mind jumped to all kinds of conclusions: what was there to gain in kidnapping Brightville�s inheritor?�</p><p>�����The acara produced a faint, defeated laugh.</p><p>������Erin you have to understand, I was so scared something had happened to you and that I�d never see you again. I felt responsible; this was your first big assignment and I felt I had let you down. I never stopped searching.� Orlitz paused, a smile tickling the corners of her mouth, �and then I tripped over your decoy duffel bag and the puzzle pieces finally fell into place.�</p><p>������That was stupid of me, I�ll admit,� Erin turned to face Orlitz at last. �I�m so, so sorry, Orlitz. Really. I never intended for you to get so invested in looking for me. And I never wanted you to get hurt. Honestly.�</p><p>�����It was difficult for the cybunny to stay mad. Erin was young, impressionable. On the other hand, her ability to formulate such a heist was a testament to her intelligence. �I have been a reporter for a while now. I�ve learned never to leave a partner behind, and I hope that�s something you learn too, someday.� The cybunny thought back to her sojourn into the haunted house. Her head throbbed in response, a ghost of the blunt trauma she had endured on that infernal ride. </p><p>������I believe you Erin. I believe you never intended for your plan to go this far. I believe Reba had a big part to play in this scheme. But why frame Sophia, of all people?�</p><p>������I�Reba suggested I�d need a scapegoat to pull this off. It made sense at the time. I mean, I was upset that Sophia had given up on Brightville. And the more I thought about it, the more I justified that, may be by framing her, I could overturn her credibility and rescue what my family built.� Erin paused a moment, �I shouldn�t have done that, I realize that now. �</p><p>������Why couldn�t you just talk to her? Maybe she�d have understood and sympathized with you.�</p><p>������Oh I tried!� Erin said dryly, �I wrote her a few times, but she either didn�t believe me or didn�t want to make amends. Besides, I wouldn�t have been able to afford the park anyways.�</p><p>�����For the first time, something in Erin�s demeanor changed. She curled into herself and produced a tiny, barely perceptible sob. �I wished I could have saved Brightville. Now I really have nothing left of my family.� Her face crumpled and tears began to roll down her cheeks in earnest. �I don�t want to let Brightville go.� </p><p>�����Orlitz reached over and placed a reassuring hand on the acara�s shoulder. It was painful to see her like this. If only there was some way they could rescue this dynasty� if only they could return the park to its former glory. </p><p>������Don�t lose hope just yet, Erin,� she offered, �Reba is probably using us to further stall the demolition. So long as we�re missing, nothing�s going to happen to the park.� She desperately wished her words were true, but how long would they have to stay up here?</p><p>�����Just then, the park-wide loudspeaker system sprung to life. Though Erin and Orlitz were stuck well above Brightville, they could hear the message clearly:</p><p>������Looks like another esteemed guest has been captured within your beloved park. But maybe that�s not enough to convince you to stop with this demolition. Maybe I�ll need to take more guests to make my message heard. It�s no use looking, you�ll never find them. If this demolition goes on as planned, it will be on your conscience, Sophia!� </p><p>�����* * * * * </p><p>������Yes thank you, I can take it from here. I said thank you.� Iskeen mustered whatever milligram of strength she had left to produce a somewhat-convincing smile for the guards who had escorted�or rather, dragged�her back to the house. �Thank you very much, have a wonderful night!� The ixi made as if she were unlocking the front door until the guards were out of sight. Once they had vanished, she ducked into the backyard and sank into the grass. </p><p>�����Being escorted out of the park and back to the Livia residence had been a grandiose waste of her time, not least of all because Iskeen did not have a key to the house. She felt like crying: was Orlitz alright? Was she safe? What had Reba done with her?</p><p>������Now�s not the time to cry,� she sniffed. She needed to find Orlitz�s parents�they must still be in the plaza. Then, she had to get back into the park, regardless of Sophia�s request. It was probably too late to find a uni cab, but Iskeen spotted a bike leaning against a tree from the corner of her eye.</p><p>������That�ll do.�</p><p>�����* * * * * </p><p>�����Elva and Keon had settled by the fountain, nearly asleep, by the time Iskeen found them. They sat upright when they heard her approaching on the bike. </p><p>�����Keon gave her a strange look. �Is that my�? Why do you have my b��</p><p>������Reba caught Orlitz and I was kicked out of the park, I came back here as fast as I could!� Iskeen said, jumping off the bicycle, �we need to get into the tunnels now.� </p><p>�����Elva gasped. So did Keon. Following behind Iskeen, they hurried to the hidden entrance to the tunnel, but froze when they saw that the bench was now flanked by guards on every side. Sophia must have sounded the alarm. </p><p>������What do we do now?� Elva whispered shakily, �there�s no way they will let us through.�</p><p>������I�m not sure�� Iskeen blinked, �wait! The protestors! They�re already at the Brightville gate, maybe we can get in with their help.� </p><p>�����Iskeen was correct. As the trio approached the amusement park, they were met with a crowd of furious protestors pushing with increasing force against the closed gates. Members of the Brightvale Guard were trying in vain to settle the masses, but it seemed as though everyone had been extremely agitated by the loudspeaker announcements. Many of the guests inside where gathering on the other side of the gate, trying to leave. </p><p>������It�s you!� Iskeen spun around as a Speckled draik approached her�Lou! �Did you hear what happened? Someone else was kidnapped!�</p><p>������That was Orlitz! She and I found the culprit, we found Erin! I managed to get away but they caught her.� Iskeen dragged the draik aside. Now was not the time for subtlety or niceties: �we have to get back in there and rescue them! Sophia Grigsby won�t listen to reason, she wants the party to go on as though nothing is wrong. But what if Orlitz is hurt?!�</p><p>�����Meanwhile, Elva and Keon were busy reasoning with the guards behind the gate. They would not budge: if there was a kidnapper among them, no one was permitted to leave the park, but the crowd on either side of the gate was now inexorable: Brightville�s farewell celebration was devolving into a great powder keg. </p><p>������Reba Watt is behind this,� Iskeen cried through the bars, �she won�t leave the park, it means too much to her. You have to believe us!� </p><p>�����Lou had turned his attention back to the rabble of protestors. He was rallying them. Inside the park, more and more of the prestigious guests were gathering at the gate, yelling to be let out. </p><p>�����Iskeen had trouble seeing what happened next. She surmised that one way or another, the gates had been pushed open because neopets were pouring out of the park while others were shoving their way in. She followed the wave of protesters through the gates, but lost sight of Orlitz�s parents in the process. For a brief second, she glimpsed a pair of cybunny ears and pushed her way towards them.</p><p>������THE FERRIS WHEEL!� she yelled, hoping that either Keon or Elva could hear her. Then, she set out towards the massive park attraction. </p><p>�����* * * * * </p><p>�����Orlitz paced around the tiny gondola, trying to calm her racing heart. They had been trapped in this wheel for nearly two hours now, and she hated small spaces. Erin had grown restless too, and was trying in vain to appear calm. Where were Iskeen and her parents? What if no one came? How much longer could she endure being trapped in a suspended pod? </p><p>�����Through the window, she noticed a rising commotion near the far side of the park, by the entrance. It was difficult to discern through the forest of trees, but could it be? It looked as though neopians were leaving the park. </p><p>�����A fresh surge of panic shot up her spine and her heart sank: they were being deserted. </p><p>�����* * * * * </p><p>�����Iskeen had difficulty discerning the ferris wheel when she approached it. The clearing, previously aglow in the multicolored lights of the carousel and the wheel, was now pitch black. Miraculously, Elva and Keon had managed to follow Iskeen away from the chaos of the crowds, and miraculously, Elva had had the good sense to bring a flashlight. </p><p>������This is where we found Erin and Reba� Iskeen motioned towards the general outline of the ferris wheel, nearly invisible against the cloudy sky, �we managed to hear a bit of their conversation before we were caught.�</p><p>������So Reba and Erin teamed up?� Keon asked.</p><p>�����Iskeen thought for a moment. When she and Orlitz had overheard their conversation, Erin seemed to have been calling the shots. However, once they were discovered, she�d detected a slight wariness and uncertainty in the acara. </p><p>������I wonder about that too,� she said. It could be that Erin had grown tired of Reba. Was she afraid of the gnorbu?</p><p>������Where�d they go?� Elva was searching the clearing with her light. Both the carousel and the ferris wheel appeared desolate. In the stillness, Iskeen felt her way towards the wheel�s platform.</p><p>������They were talking right here,� she said, �look around, maybe there�s a clue somewhere.� In the dark, she could make out a podium-like structure on the platform, which she assumed housed the ride�s controls. Iskeen ran her fingers along the controls�perhaps one of these switches would turn on the lights. Her hand bumped against a solid protrusion. �This must be the microphone they used,� she mused. </p><p>������I wouldn�t do that if I were you.� </p><p>�����She spun around. In the darkness, it was impossible to see the figure of a gnorbu coming towards her. Iskeen could only cry out as Reba collided into her. </p><p>�����</p><p><i>To be continued�</i> </p>"

      "Piece": "<p>�����<font size=5>D</font>ark had been right about everything.</p><p>�����Well, almost everything.</p><p>�����They did indeed find Belle � a pretty pirate Xweetok � in a small cove hidden behind the waterfall, and she was indeed very cold and alone. She had twisted her ankle on the way up the wall, and had been unable to continue the climb upwards. She confirmed Dark�s theory that she had only been there for a couple of days, and she also confirmed that she had assumed the crew were still looking for her.</p><p>�����The one part that Dark had gotten wrong in his was how she had fallen into the water in the first place.</p><p>������I was pushed!� She exclaimed, after exchanging several warm hugs with Soren and handshakes with the others. �I swear, Soren. We were all at the top of the cliff, and I felt someone shove me and I went over the edge. It all happened so fast.�</p><p>������But who would do that?� </p><p>������I don�t know. I�ve been racking my brains trying to figure it out. I was standing next to Ash and Mustafa. I thought Jinny was behind me � but she�d never push anyone, not in a million years.�</p><p>������Sit still,� Elena scolded as she held her wand over Belle�s injured ankle. The Xweetok sighed and sat back against the wall. In the blue glow of the campfire, she looked extremely tired.</p><p>������Been a rough couple of days, huh?� Dark gave her paw a sympathetic squeeze.</p><p>������Days? Try a rough week! From getting attacked by those pirates and ending up here, and getting stuck down a watering hole � yeah, it�s been rough.�</p><p>������Someone really needs to do something about those pirates,� Dark mused, as Elena mumbled something under her breath as she waved her wand. Soren raised an eyebrow at him.</p><p>������One problem at a time, buddy. We�ve got to get off this island.�</p><p>������They�ve already left, haven�t they?� Belle asked, her eyes downcast. Dark had explained his time distortion theory, and the possibility that the others had presumed them missing (or dead) after a few weeks and had gone on without them.</p><p>������They probably waited for a storm � their best opportunity to get past the sea monster. Where they�ll end up � we may never know.�</p><p>������And what about us? We have no boat, no way of navigating the seas and no way of getting off this island. And unless Elena can work a miracle � I can�t see myself climbing to the top of this wall any time soon.�</p><p>������Hmph.� Elena wiped away a small bead of sweat that had broken out on her forehead and sat back. �Healing spells are complex, okay? It�ll take a few go�s.� She heaved an exhausted sigh and Dark gave her a consoling pat on the shoulder. </p><p>������It feels a lot better already,� Belle replied gratefully, although Dark detected a slight hint of a lie in her eyes. He appreciated it all the same.</p><p>������It�s nearly dawn,� Soren held his paw up to his mouth to stifle a yawn. �Let�s catch a couple of hours kip and regroup later. We have a lot to do today.�</p><p>�����The others mumbled their agreement, and Dark�s eyes were closed before he hit the floor.</p><p>�����***</p><p>�����Some time later, Dark awoke to the uncomfortable heaviness of Sebastian sitting on his chest. The Meepit was staring at him with his eerie wide eyes, and Dark wondered just how long he�d been there. He picked him up and placed him gently on the floor beside him, where the Meepit promptly leapt back up onto him. They had an odd sort of wrestle for a minute or two, before Dark gave up and let Sebastian sit on him as the others started to wake up.</p><p>�����After an imaginary breakfast (Dark had pancakes, fruit and ice cream, with a strong black coffee on the side) and a quick outline of the plan for the day, the group were ready to go.</p><p>�����Until.</p><p>������Sebastian what are you DOING?� The Meepit was running headfirst into the rocky wall of the cave, tumbling backwards � and doing it all over again. It was about the fourth collision that Elena noticed, and rushed over to stop him. She picked him up and tried to examine his head, but the petpet was not having a bar of it. He thrashed and writhed in her arms, throwing himself back at the wall. It took all of the Cybunny�s strength to hold onto him, and Dark rushed forward to help.</p><p>������Sebastian!� He managed to fling himself out of Elena�s arms and into the wall again. This time, a small chip of rock broke off and fell to the floor with a soft clatter. Looking pleased with himself, Sebastian picked up the rock and tossed it into his mouth, crunching down happily.</p><p>������Your Meepit is really weird,� Belle said, as Sebastian started at the wall again. Dark scooped him up just in time and wrapped his arms around him in a tight vice.</p><p>������You�re telling us. You should have seen what he did with the ��</p><p>������Dark,� Elena breathed, pushing him out of her way as she peered at the cave wall more closely. She waved her wand once and a small pink flame illuminated the end, like a small torch. She held it up to the rock and leaned closer still.</p><p>������What is it, Elena?� Soren and Belle stepped closer, and Sebastian stopped squirming in the Draik�s grip. </p><p>������There�s writing on here. It�s a bit caked by dirt and rock � but Sebastian knocked some off, see? Help me clear it.� </p><p>�����The five of them (including Sebastian) set to work of clearing the hard sediment that covered the wall and revealing the words and symbols underneath. They glowed a faint blue, and the entire wall was warm to the touch.</p><p>�����Elena ran her paws over the writing and closed her eyes. She could feel a gentle thrumming running through the rock.</p><p>������Is it magic?� Dark whispered, and she smiled at him without opening her eyes.</p><p>������Old magic, Dark. Really old. This whole place � it�s alive with it.�</p><p>�����Dark reached out a hand to touch the wall. It was warm, and vibrated slightly, but he couldn�t feel the energy that Elena could. He wished � and not for the first time � that he had magic. </p><p>������The symbols are runes � I can�t read all of them, but some are easy. This one here �� The pink Cybunny pointed at one of the glowing blue rune that was shaped like a rising sun. �This is the symbol for time. Not like midday or morning or whatever � time itself.�</p><p>������Cool.� Dark was scraping off a layer of dirt on one of the runes with his sharp fingernail. Underneath was a glowing blue snake, coiled in a circle with its head chasing its tail. �What�s this one?�</p><p>������Eternal life, I think. Not that there is such a thing, but there�s been plenty of villains trying to give it a go.� Nobody felt the need to mention one F. Sloth aloud, but it was there in their minds. That pesky Darigan Eyrie, too.</p><p>������How on Neopia did Sebastian know they were here? He�s useless.� Dark glanced over into the corner where the Meepit was happily crunching on the sediment they had chipped off the wall. �And what do they mean, Elena?�</p><p>������I don�t know. But I can feel my magic charging up just by being in here. Let me try something.� Placing one pink paw on the wall, Elena pointed her wand at Belle�s maimed ankle and closed her eyes. </p><p>�����Nothing happened for a good few minutes, until the pirate Xweetok gasped aloud and set her foot down, one paw grasping Soren�s shoulder. She carefully tested the ankle before jumping up and down excitedly, feeling no pain.</p><p>������Elena � you did it!�</p><p>�����Dark reached out to engulf his friend in a hug as Soren wrapped his arms around Belle, pulling her in close. </p><p>������Using this magic, do you think you�ll be able to get us out of here? Off the island I mean. I can definitely climb this cliff now.�</p><p>������Once we make it to the shore, I�ll see what I can do. We need to make it to our side of the island � that is, the side me and Dark landed on. That way we�ll still be in our correct time zone, and won�t have been missing for a couple years. Can you imagine Lis without Sebastian? She�d kill me.�</p><p>������That Sebastian? Really?� Belle looked at the orange Meepit in the corner eating dirt and made a face.</p><p>������He used to be a lot better,� Elena replied, remembering fondly of the days when Sebastian had been a Krawk and had been well behaved. �Wait a minute � the Krawk! It must have gone with the rest of the pirates. Oh no!�</p><p>�����Soren had been quiet for a minute, deep in thought. When he spoke, his voice was low. </p><p>������Our plan is good � make it out of this cavern, head back to your side of the island where time is running correctly. Then get your boat, Elena can make a storm and we�ll sail past the sea monster. Anybody else see the problem with this plan?�</p><p>�����Dark buried his face in his hands with a groan.</p><p>������We don�t have a boat.�</p><p>������Oh, for the love of Fyora��</p><p>�����<b>The End.</b> </p>"

      "Filename": "579972",
      "Piece": "<p>�����<font size=5>M</font>argot�s house was exactly as Clarise remembered it. Way too big, full of way too much stuff. It wasn�t decorated in the Shenkuu style, not in the slightest. Most of the furniture had been imported from old Neovia. The curtains were made of the absolute heaviest fabric on the market, and all the seats were topped with the same stiff brocade covers. It was more like a poorly curated museum, than an actual home.</p><p>�����Clarise�s quarters in Virtupets were modern minimalism, through and through. She�d had one picture of her with the sales team, but that had gotten trashed after a weak sales quarter. The fools on the sales team didn�t deserve a spot on her wall.</p><p>�����There were plenty of pictures hanging on Margot�s walls. Most of them were of Margot. It looked like Margot had also been a faerie krawk and a maractite krawk, before settling on her current eventide exterior. There was a full size painted portrait of Margot in a pastel floral gown, above the fireplace. Margot was painted faerie, in the portrait. A date in the corner proudly announced that it had been painted only a few months ago. That must have been embarrassing, Clarise thinks, to have had that commissioned and then be painted a totally different color immediately after.</p><p>�����A number of the pictures actually featured Terry and Alexi and, astonishingly, Clarise. One hanging next to the stairs showed the four of them, all in one place and smiling, a rarely synchronized moment. Terry was in the center of the photo, as was custom, but she had an arm draped around Clarise. Alexi and Margot bookended them, grinning like someone had just offered them an all-expenses-paid trip to the NC mall. The picture was small, only about the size of a postcard, but it was cased in the gaudiest frame on the wall.</p><p>�����There weren't any pictures hanging of Margot and her new friends. Because really, Clarise was sure, Margot had new friends. New friends to talk about absolutely nothing with, and obsess over the absolute shallowest trends with.</p><p>�����But it had been fun, sometimes. A part of her whispered. You missed them. She pushed that part to the back of her mind. Obviously talking about UsukiCon had been more fun than doing actual work. That didn't mean Margot and the others weren't crummy friends. Even if Margot did have that photo of them all framed.</p><p>�����***</p><p>�����Margot suggested that they all could lay out sleeping bags and blankets on the living room floor. It'd be a sleepover, like old times sake. Alexi sort of liked that idea. Clarise had said no, that would be ridiculous. There were more than enough guest rooms.</p><p>�����Alexi dropped her backpack down in one such room. It was bigger than her entire neohome in Neopia Central. Nicer, too. There were little decorations hanging on all the walls. Neovian inspired, she thought. Margot had always wanted to visit Neovia. Alexi wondered if she had ever gotten the chance to go. Alexi would have loved to go with her. Margot made traveling fun. Alexi was always worried about following the map and sticking to the travel checklist. Margot was more concerned with taking fun pictures, and seeing everything there was to see.</p><p>�����The just wasn�t time for traveling these days, though. Alexi only had two days off from work, and that was it for her vacation days until next year. It was worth it, to see everyone, but it meant that her planned day trip to Roo Island was officially off the itinerary. Who wanted to see Roo Island, anyways?</p><p>�����There was a knock on the door, and Alexi sprung across the room to fling it open. Margot stood in the hallway, looking at her feet.</p><p>������I wasn�t sure if you�d still be unpacking.� Margot said.</p><p>�����Alexi looked back into the room at her solitary backpack. Technically, she supposed, it was not yet unpacked.</p><p>������I travel light.� She told Margot.</p><p>�����Margot wandered in, a little self-consciously for the fact that they were in Margot�s house. She leaned against the dresser, picking at a purple-polished nail. Purple was a great color on Margot. It complimented her gradient of glossy, evening-colored scales. Margot had always made an effort to eat lots of protein, so her scales would be at their best. Alexi expected her own scales were somewhat less vibrant than Margot�s. That was the downside to living off of tinned prunes and breadfish for months at a time.</p><p>������So, um.� Margot started.</p><p>�����Alexi dutifully looked up. She had been picking at the cloud-fluffy bedspread with a sort of inexplicable nervous energy.</p><p>������You�re probably wondering why I sent you all those neomails?� Margot asked.</p><p>�����Actually, Alexi hadn�t been wondering. She had assumed Margot felt her same sense of nostalgia for old friends, combined with the means to actually feel proud about inviting them all to visit. But if there was an ulterior motive, that was fine too, she supposed.</p><p>�����***</p><p>����� ����The four sat in Margot�s living room. Terry knew this room well. She remembered building a big blanket fort in the living room, clustering together underneath to tell ghost stories. That had been on-camera. Margot had been so afraid of the stories, but Terry had assumed the fear was just played up for the show. No one was actually that afraid of the Haunted Woods, Terry had thought. Maybe Margot was. Maybe that was part of why Terry had been such a bad friend. Maybe while Terry was looking around the living room with a sense of warm familiarity, Margot was looking around, feeling betrayal and stale fear.</p><p>������The studio contacted Margot.� Alexi said. Margot was sitting next to her on the sofa, nodding in agreement, but avoiding eye contact. Alexi looked like she was bordering on frantic, herself. Her easy vibrancy had really taken a turn for wild-eyed burnout, somewhere along the way.</p><p>������The studio?� Clarise asked. �What�d they want?�</p><p>������They want to reboot the show.� Alexi said.</p><p>�����Clarise laughed. It wasn�t a pretty sound. Usually, Clarise had such a lovely-sounding laugh. �What�d you tell them?�</p><p>������I told them I�d ask you all.� Margot said, to the shag carpeting.</p><p>�����Clarise stopped laughing. She thought for a moment, in the coldly calculating way she sometimes did. It was an action that had become both colder and more calculating, since the last time Terry had seen her.</p><p>������Is that why we�re here?� Clarise asked.</p><p>�����Alexi and Margot both looked a little deflated. Terry wasn�t sure why Clarise was making them admit it out loud. Couldn�t that just go unsaid, and they could all pretend they were still friends, for a little longer?</p><p>������That�s why I invited you here.� Margot said, very quiet, and very small.</p><p>�����Terry remembered Margot moderating a million fights. She had never once been quiet, and she had never once been small. None of them had been.</p><p>�����Clarise, at least, refused to be quiet or small, now. �You�re unbelievable. We haven�t so much as spoken in five years. Why would you ever even for a minute think we�d want to be back in that horrible Neovision show?� Her tail flicked back and forth angrily, and her fur bristled on end.</p><p>�����Margot faced that anger with guilty acceptance. She was wearing black trousers, so the lighter sunrise colors striping her legs weren�t visible. She appeared exclusively deep blue, dotted with stars.</p><p>����� �����I�d do the show.� Alexi said.</p><p>������What?� Clarise yelled.</p><p>������I need the neopoints.� Alexi said. It was as if the combined airspace taken up by Clarise and Alexi�s words could only be so big. For every outburst from Clarise, Alexi shied away more.</p><p>������Sellout.� Clarise accused.</p><p>������I know.� Alexi said. �But with the kind of neopoints they�re offering...It doesn�t matter, actually. The show, I mean. Without Terry, they wouldn�t care about us. We were just there to support Terry�s weekly storyline.�</p><p>�����Everyone turned to look at Terry. Terry thought back to every time every camera was aimed at her. She had spent so much time floundering in that electronic gaze. Then she had thought she�d mastered the art of saying exactly what was expected, in the most entertaining way, but that hadn�t been quite right either. She�d been awful to her closest friends in the world. Alexi and Margot and Clarise had been her only friends, and she�d berated them all publicly for an audience�s entertainment. She deserved to be stuck up on Terror Mountain with only Feather for company. She barely deserved Feather�s company.</p><p>�����But for all she did or didn�t deserve, her house on Terror Mountain was the loneliest place in Neopia. She couldn�t go back there, alone, and know that she had left behind any sort of hope of a chance of reconciling with the others. Maybe she could stay in Shenkuu, and do the show, and be the worst again, like they all expected her to be, but make the others understand that it was never their fault. They never deserved to be the victims of Terry�s Neovision presence. She could be awful, without being awful to them, right? It�d take some talented acting, but that�s what Terry was best at. She had been such a good actor that no one had even known she was acting.</p><p>������I�ll do the show.� She told them.</p><p>������I...are you all crazy?� Clarise asked. �Terry, I thought you were trying to be, like, less horrifyingly obnoxious.�</p><p>�����Terry could feel tears poking the back of her eyes. She was probably going to cry. She accepted it, and could continue the conversation with cognizant awareness that she was going to fall apart at some point during the next three sentences.</p><p>�����She took a deep breath. �I�ve been so lonely. I don�t want to do the show...but if it�s the only way you�ll all keep hanging out with me��</p><p>�����Margot beat her to the waterworks. She let out a big gulping sob, then loudly blew her nose. �Terry, I�ll hang out with you no matter what. I missed you so much.�</p><p>������I was so terrible to you, though.� Terry said.</p><p>�����Margot shook her head. �You were trying to be a perfect Neovision reality star. You�re different now.�</p><p>�����Terry climbed onto the sofa between Margot and Alexi, resting her head on Margot�s shoulder. The two of them were both still in tears. They were a different sort of tears, though, Terry thought. Kind of a cathartic, things are going to work out after all and maybe be okay in the end type of crying.</p><p>������So we aren�t doing the show?� Alexi asked. �I mean, I�m okay if we don�t do the show��</p><p>������I�m certainly not doing the show.� Clarise said, looking at the conglomeration of snotty-nosed crying on the sofa with disdain. �I have to get back to work in a few days.�</p><p>������Me too, I guess� Alexi said. �Do you want to join us on the sofa?�</p><p>������No.� Clarise said.</p><p>�����Alexi nodded. �Okay. You know, I don�t think I ever told you how much I missed you. I�m really glad you�ve been successful, and I know you�ve always liked to work independently, and that you�ve got your work on Virtupets now, but I miss hearing about your crazy adventures.�</p><p>�����Through eyes blurry with tears, Terry can see Clarise smile. Maybe, for all the years it�s been, Alexi still has that knack for knowing just what to say to make everything okay again in the end.</p><p>������Maybe I will sit with you all on the sofa.� Clarise said.</p><p>������Bring it in.� Alexi said.</p><p>������If you get snot on me I�m leaving.� Clarise told her.</p><p>�����***</p><p>�����It had been three months since that visit. The Neovision studio had been disappointed to hear that Shenkuu Mountain Pets would not be returning for a season three. Disappointed, but not surprised, Margot thought. It had been a long shot.</p><p>�����Margot had missed the show. She had missed waking up to whatever crazy nonsense dramatics Terry dredged up, and she had missed Alexi buzzing around like a poppit on a sugar rush, and she had missed Clarise showing up at dinnertime with her insane get-rich-quick ventures. She had missed the energy and the life of it all, staying in Shenkuu long after they had all gone. They had moved to bigger and better things, and she had stayed in place, waiting for them to come back. The neighborhood had lost its sheen, and no amount of repainting or reorganizing or redecorating had fixed it.</p><p>�����These days, Margot still missed the show sometimes, but she missed it a whole lot less. She liked thoughtful, creative Terry so much more than theatrical, aggressive Terry. Terry would still try anything once, but she�d do it because she wanted to learn and experience, not just because someone expected it of her. Margot liked Alexi�s newfound sense of confident purpose. Alexi�s old excitement for everything now seemed so hollow next to the genuine drive she had for her new job. Clarise was happier, too. She had felt left out, Margot now realized. Alexi, in her great social wisdom, had noticed first, and now the two of them were helping each other. Clarise had gotten Alexi a job in sales, up in the Virtupets Space Station. Alexi had given Clarise the genuine compassion she had been missing. Margot received a neomail from them two weeks ago. Alexi wrote about how beautiful space was, and how much fun they were having exploring Kreludor on the weekends. Clarise wrote about how she was pleased to report the GRUUNDO sales team was having its most lucrative quarter on record. That was as close as Clarise was going to get to saying she was thrilled to have a friend.</p><p>�����Margot couldn�t fault Clarise for that. She was also thrilled to have a friend. She checked her watch. There was still an hour until the boat left, so she and Terry still had time to get food before the official start of their vacation.</p><p>�����Not a vacation, Terry had reminded her. A business trip, practically. A voyage up to Happy Valley, to officially sign papers selling Terry�s old neohome. It had been in perfect condition to sell. Practically unlived in.</p><p>�����Terry was going to come back to Shenkuu, and stay in one of Margot�s guest rooms. Margot certainly had enough space to house a tiny kacheek and a yoakie. Not to say that Margot wouldn�t have found room for Terry in any neohome. She and Terry were going to finally have their chance to be real best friends, off-camera. They were going to build a blanket fort in the living room, but they weren�t going to tell ghost stories. They were going to make hot chocolate and paint their nails.</p><p>�����And once Terry and Feather were all settled in, then they could go on a real vacation. Margot had always wanted to see Neovia.</p><p> <b>The End. </b></p>"

One of our Whinnys escaped from the pen, so I sought to find it in the morning.� Elijah�s eyes went to the ground. �It was a stormy day, but I couldn�t let it slow me down. But instead of finding the Whinny, I found her.� </p><p>�����Whispers of shock and suspicion filled the room from the court goers.</p><p>������She must be a spy for Darigan!�</p><p>������There must be more of them!�</p><p>������Then sentence her already! What are we waiting for?�</p><p>�����The kougra raised her arm once again, and upon spotting the gavel, the courtroom gradually settled down. </p><p>������What did she want from you, Gawain?� At her question, Elijah turned to Sylvana, and sadness filled his blue eyes, eyes that begged for forgiveness.</p><p>������She wanted death to take her,� he answered quietly.</p><p>�����The judge was silent as she processed his answer, her face devoid of emotions.</p><p>������It was when lightning struck the fields that I saw her. She was barely standing and her fur soaked by the rain. When I approached, she collapsed, her body only staying together through sheer stubbornness.�</p><p>������But she is a darigan.�</p><p>�����Elijah nodded. �I am aware. But it was not just her wings and darkened fur that gave it away. She carried a large weapon, a halberd axe. It was the only thing that allowed her to stand. I know a Meridellian weapon when I see one, and upon seeing it, I knew her weapon was not of this land.�</p><p>�����The judge paused before asking the next question, as if hesitating. �Gawain, sir, the Council understands that you and your wife sustained losses during the second Meridell-Darigan War?�</p><p>������We did. We lost our son in the final battle of the war.� </p><p>�����The judge nodded. �What did you do after she collapsed?�</p><p>�����Elijah took in a deep breath. �I took her home to Arya.�</p><p>�����Uneasy mumbles and murmurs arose in the hall, but not nearly as loud as the previous times. Sylvana watched as the court goers glanced to one another, mouths moving, asking questions. Though she couldn�t hear them clearly, she guessed that they were asking how someone who had experienced loss during the war could be so merciful to the main enemy. Even Sylvana herself had no idea why he showed such mercy to her. Noticing the unease in the room, Elijah glanced towards the crowd.</p><p>������My son has been gone for years now. But my wife and I knew we could not let ourselves drown in grief.� He lifted his head towards Arya, and Sylvana could see tears forming in the corners of his eyes. �While we could never forget what happened, we could not let the past get in the way of our present actions.� </p><p>������So what did you do, then?,� the kougra asked.</p><p>������Seeing her in the rain, she showed signs of malnourishment and a fever. There was so much loss in the war, I couldn�t bear to see it claim another victim. So we took her in and helped her regain her strength.� In his mind, images of the weary kyrii flashed in Elijah�s mind from that stormy morning. Her ribs nearly protruded from under her skin, cuts tore all across her body, and her breaths were short and forced. If he and Arya had not taken her in, Elijah could only imagine what kind of fate she could have met. </p><p>�����The kougra nodded. Just like the court goers, she had no idea how someone could show mercy to the enemy, one who could have taken their son away from them. She then stared at Sylvana, taking the kyrii�s rather muscular form, the scar that tore across her left arm, and her torn right ear. Imagining her as starved and weakened almost seem implausible, given her former status as a warrior.</p><p>�����Watching the judge practically scan her sent an even heavier, crushing feeling on Sylvana�s shoulders. She was the enemy through and through, and even when in the face of her worst enemy, she was given mercy. Was it because of her inability to fight back or was it her giving into her own weakness?</p><p>������It was tricky at first, getting her to recover,� Elijah continued. �She was so insistent on not eating, not regaining her strength, I nearly gave up on her. She was a stubborn child. But my wife...she refused to lose hope. Eventually, something in the girl clicked. She finally started to eat, and gradually, her strength returned to her.�</p><p>�����The judge, surrounding magistrates, and court goers were silent.</p><p>������When she finally grew strong enough, she offered to work on our farm. As you can tell, my wife and I aren�t as able-bodied as we used to be. We gladly accepted the help.�</p><p>������But your voice suggests no fear,� the kougra interjected. �Were you not afraid of a potential betrayal for your kindness?�</p><p>������Despite her color, she wants absolutely nothing to do with the Darigan Citadel. Just the sheer mention of it makes her flinch.�</p><p>������She said this to you outright?�</p><p>������No,� Elijah admitted, shaking his head. �If just the name of her homeland causes her pain, surely her past with it must be even more so. My wife and I both promised to never ask her.�</p><p>�����The judge raised an eyebrow. �So how do you assume her feelings if you never asked her?�</p><p>�����Elijah winced, something that Sylvana noticed. He looked conflicted, as if he had no right to speak of a girl�s past, something he had no idea about. But he quickly opened his eyes as murmurs and whispers arose again.</p><p>������Just her reaction to the mention of that land was enough to understand. But...there was something else I noticed.�</p><p>������What was it?�</p><p>������The way she handled her weapon. The night I first saw it, it appeared as an ordinary halberd. But days later, while working in the fields, I saw her unravel a bundle she had hidden, and it was more than a singular object - it looked as if it was pieces of something. It was then I realized that they were pieces of her axe. Her weapon had been broken.�</p><p>�����The zafara magistrate leaned forward, curious and suspicious. �What did you do next?�</p><p>�����Elijah�s eyes went to the ground, almost laden with what looked like guilt. �I took the axe to Sir Aldrid. Stories tell that not only was he a talented fighter, he was also an expert blacksmith.�</p><p>������And what compelled you to take it to him?� The kougra also leaned forward.</p><p>������I thought�� His voice faded into silence as he glanced at Sylvana sorrowfully. �...that perhaps if the axe was mended, she would be relieved of the pain she had been carrying for so long. It must be such a heavy burden to bear, I wanted her to be relieved of it.� </p><p>�����The crowd erupted once again in whispers and even several bouts of shouting, something both Elijah and Sylvana ignored. Both the ogrin and kyrii were only focused on one another, and soon, Sylvana�s felt sorrow in her chest that matched Elijah�s pale blue eyes.</p><p>������Father�� Her voice was nearly inaudible.</p><p>�����Both the zafara magistrate and the kougra judge leaned back in their chairs, realizing that Elijah had finished his testimony.</p><p>������The Council of Meridell thanks you for sharing your story,� the kougra stated. �Your testimony is finished, correct?�</p><p>�����Elijah nodded.</p><p>������Very well. We shall continue.� The kougra�s eyes glanced at the table, where several open books and scrolls lay rampant across. One particular scroll she lifted close, her pale pink eyes scanning, until she placed it down and looked towards the bailiff. </p><p>������Bring in the axe.�</p><p>�����From the side doors, three knights came carrying a large bundle. A dark grey handle extended out, but only the top part of the weapon was concealed by the bundle. The knights then placed the bundle on the table before the judge and magistrates.</p><p>������Remove the cover,� the zafara magistrate ordered.</p><p>�����The knights did as ordered, slowly removing the tarp until the weapon was revealed in its entirety - a large halberd axe. Though the sheer size of the weapon was enough to draw gasps from the crowd, it was the blade that drew the most attention. The jagged blade was carved with runes unlike anything the judge had seen before. The axe in its entirety was large, surely much too large for even the strongest and most experienced of knights, let alone the young kyrii who once wielded it. </p><p>�����But interestingly, the axe�s blade was practically shattered, as if Skarl himself had smashed it with his infamous mace. While the edge by itself was menacing by itself with its jagged edge, when placed back together next to its remaining pieces, it formed quite the imposing axe blade, one that paled in comparison to any size axe Skarl and his knights had. </p><p>�����The judge looked at Sylvana, motioning to the blade. �This is your axe, correct?�</p><p>�����In her heart, Sylvana didn�t want to acknowledge the judge�s question. She had wanted to get rid of it for so long, dispose of it so that she would never see it again. For Sylvana, it was a constant reminder of the one land she wanted nothing to do with, the one land she was born in, and the one place in all of Neopia she hated most.</p><p>�����But against her feelings, she nodded.</p><p>�����</p><p><i>To be continued�</i> </p>"
