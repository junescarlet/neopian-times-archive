<p>     So you want to celebrate Sloth Appreciation day but do not know how? Let me give you a list of top foods to celebrate Dr. Sloth. Now I know what you are thinking… Sloth Appreciation Day is not a foodie holiday, which is fair. The Sloth themed foods around Neopia are few and far between, the edible ones even less so. I’ve sampled every Sloth dish around and can recommend you several options for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert. You will not be eating the most exotic foods or even the fanciest foods, but I will guarantee that you will eat delicious food if you listen to my recommendations. </p><p>     Breakfast</p><p>     They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and it is hard to argue with that. Your breakfast sets the tone for your day. If you want to have a good start to Sloth Appreciation Day there are two dishes I would recommend. They are on the lighter side, as your lunch and dinner options will have more sustenance.</p><p>     Though Sloth Appreciation Day is celebrated during the winter, I would recommend trying the Dr. Sloth Summer Fruit Salad. It’s a unique combination of strawberries, blueberries, and some mysterious Sloth shaped fruit. I wasn’t able to identify what the mysterious fruit was, but it was a strange combination of sweet and tangy. It was a little unsettling to eat fruit shaped like Sloth, but the unique flavor kept me hooked. There is one disclaimer that comes when eating this fruit salad and that is that Neopian domination is not included. If you’re looking or a way to take over Neopia, I’d suggest reading a different article.</p><p>     The second breakfast item I would recommend is the Cherry Sloth Yogurt. You can pair this with the Dr. Sloth Summer Fruit Salad but it can also stand alone as a light breakfast item. If you had a hard time stomaching the Sloth shaped fruit, this might be a better option for you. The cherry yogurt is simply served in a dish that resembles Dr. Sloth’s head. The yogurt is impeccable and has an authentic cherry flavor. I was shocked to find out this food is a Space Food.</p><p>     Lunch</p><p>     I’m not a big lunch person myself, but you will definitely find me lunching on Sloth Appreciation Day. I was even able to find a vegetarian option for all the vegetarians out there in Neopia. These are two different options and even if you were hungry enough I am not sure I would recommend them together. However, to each their own. It’s your Sloth Appreciation Day, celebrate it how you want!</p><p>     My personal favorite lunch item was the Sloth Day Nachos. I was told not to ask what was in it when I ordered it, which scared me. However, I found they tasted like ordinary nachos. There was an essence of sloth in it. The dish it’s served in looks like his robe and the green substance, which tasted like guacamole, reminded me of the man himself. The chips were crisp with the perfect ratio of salt. The tomatoes were the perfect size, and the portion size was ideal. I can’t certify this as vegetarian though, because no one could confirm its ingredients.</p><p>     Now for the vegetarian option! This one was a bit tricky to track down. It’s a rare food, but I can confidently say it was worth the trouble to find. This is an exotic option. I can’t tell you what the wrap is. It’s black, it resembles his robe. It has the texture of an ordinary wrap, but there’s something in the taste that I just can’t put my finger on. You definitely need to be a bold eater to try this. It also comes in a non-vegetarian option if that is what floats your boat.</p><p>     Dinner</p><p>     If you still have room for food on this Sloth Appreciation day, you’re in for quite a surprise. Literally. One of the foods I am recommending is to say the least, something you have never tried before. But we’ll get into that in a bit. Both options are filling, but I ask that you leave some room for dessert!</p><p>     For our less adventurous eaters, I would recommend enjoying the Plain Sloth Day Burger as a way to dedicate your dinner to Sloth. The word plain is a bit misleading. This is another meal that you can’t identify all the ingredients. There’s a bun, and a burger. There’s also some lettuce. However, there is an odd green sauce and I can tell you it’s not avocado. I can’t identify the taste, but it pairs nicely with the rest of the burger. It was also a dish created in honor of Sloth Appreciation Day, so what better day to try it on!</p><p>     As you know, Space Food can be an acquired taste. It’s exotic, it’s often unidentifiable, but sometimes you find diamonds in the rough. The Sloth Surprise is one of those. The resemblance to SLoth is uncanny, who knows maybe it’s what Sloth tastes like. I can’t be sure. I can’t say anything about this dish. All I know is that if you’re bold enough, you should try it. Words simply cannot describe the experience of eating a Sloth Surprise.</p><p>     Dessert</p><p>     Dessert is arguably the best part of food. I know it was my favorite part of the research for this article. I sampled every dessert, and there was no bad one. Even the Sloth Cheese Cake was edible. However, to keep things consistent, I will give you my top two. If you want more, I would encourage you to go out and sample the other desserts!</p><p>     If you want something a little different, I would suggest the Grape Sloth Cake. I know what you’re thinking “... a grape cake?” Yes, reader! A grape cake. It’s so sweet and dense. It looks like Kreludor with Sloth planting a flag at the top. The Sloth figurine is not edible, I tried. However, it makes for a great little toy to commemorate your Sloth Appreciation Day! This cake is so filling, but it is possible to eat the whole thing in one sitting.</p><p>     If you are looking for something a little more traditional and not so filling, I would recommend the Sloth Cone. You’ve got to eat it quickly as it melts pretty fast and loses its Sloth form. There’s extra cone with this ice cream and it’s a delicious waffle cone! The ice cream itself tasted like pistachio to me, but I’ve heard others say it tastes like lime. Regardless, it was delicious and a great way to cap off Sloth Appreciation Day</p><p>      </p>
