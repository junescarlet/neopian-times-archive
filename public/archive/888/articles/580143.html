You are truly a mischievous soul who is young at heart and love nothing more than having fun but, despite common belief, you do it without malice – only enthusiasm! You just LOVE pranks. Those with a sense of humour are look forward to a visit from Boochi while others are quite unsure. His past is a secret and Scientists at the Chesterpot Institute still cannot figure out the source of his green and purple ray fun. Regardless, you are baby.</p><p>      Mostly Bs:</p><p>      Punchbag Bob</p><p>      You love nature and all things organic. Some see you as boring or without personality but the truth if you’re just a kind Neopian who is there for everyone. Like Punchbag Bob, you’ve got the friendliest smile and will happily play with everyone so everybody feels included. Your brother Sid tells you that sometimes you’re a little bit tooooo nice and people can walk all over you but you don’t see it as a problem as long as everyone’s happy. Remember to always smile!</p><p>      Mostly Cs:</p><p>      Ghost Lupe</p><p>      You are mysterious and enigmatic. Like the Ghost Lupe, very little is known about you and that’s exactly the way you prefer it. He appears randomly to select Neopians with cryptic messages such as “My what tasty Neopets you have!” and “It’s rumoured that neopets that go to Mystery Island never return!” He’s not all bad though, he also restores your Neopets to full health on a whim. Similarly, you enjoy being random and doing little acts of kindness but not out of obligation.</p><p>      Mostly Ds:</p><p>      Meerca Henchmen</p><p>      Oh, you! And you!! You revel in skirting corners and doing it all with your partner in crime, just like Heermeedjet and Merouladen. Friendship and comradery are the most important things to you. You have sharp reflexes and a true criminal fortitude and you looooove shiny objects. You are sly and excel in slipping away last minute no matter how close you are to getting caught and, most importantly, you never give up.</p><p>      Mostly Es:</p><p>      Space Faerie</p><p>      Determined and courageous, you have all the composure of a guardian protector of Neopia. Your alignment is true good, just like the Space Faerie who fought the extremely evil Dr. Sloth and won. You are very strong both mentally and physically and are well respected by common folk. She is so popular, in fact, that she is the mascot for Neopets Premium and is essentially a celebrity!</p><p>      Now you know which iconic Battledome Challenger you are. Why not gather your best weapons and take your strongest pet to the Battledome and give them a challenge? Have fun and good luck! </p><p>      </p>
