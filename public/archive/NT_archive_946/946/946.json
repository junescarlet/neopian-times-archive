      "Piece": "The Storytelling Competition may be one of the most difficult contests on Neopets, and not only because you are expected to turn in writing worthy of a trophy, a handful of Neopoints and a rare item. Instead of submitting a story that is wholly yours, you must adapt to the ongoing Storytelling plot by writing what happens next, with a unique and interesting twist or development. Years ago, the STC was especially competitive, with many highly skilled storytellers always raising the bar and pushing newcomers to new heights. Though the STC is quieter nowadays, the challenge is still there, especially now that there are only five winning entries picked per week, sometimes less.<p>�����For a long time, it was the judge who started the story, and then left it for users to continue. Today, a user now has the option to submit a starter or a beginning instead of continuing an ongoing story. They would have complete control over the story and the opportunity to set the stage and put together the plot. Plus, there�s a certain thrill in being able to start Storytelling and then sitting back to watch what other users do with your material. More often than not, the starter you just wrote will be going places you never thought it could reach. A Storytelling starter is also a good way to utilize an idea you can�t quite squeeze a full-length Neopian Times story out of, or to get in a little writing practice. </p><p>�����Do you want to write your own Storytelling starter (and hopefully add a new trophy to your collection)? Look no further, grab a writing implement of your choice and get ready to begin a story that would make even The Storyteller proud!</p><p>�����<b>That�s great, but when do we even submit STC beginnings?</b></p><p>�����Good question. The Storytelling format has not changed since the old days, and entries are still submitted through the text box on the Storytelling page. That was how it was when the judge started each story. </p><p>�����If you want to submit a starter, wait until the current Storytelling Competition ends, which is usually on Friday NST, and type your work into the box. There seems to be no limit to the number of beginnings you can send, so if you have more than one idea or version, send them too. </p><p>�����Sometimes the STC is irregularly updated, with no new entries posted for a few days, so in that case you must wait and see when the ending goes up and seize the opportunity then. Unfortunately, this places users in certain time zones at a disadvantage especially when the ending is published in the following week and a new Storytelling begins on the same day, leaving only a small window for starters to be submitted that can easily be missed if, say, you�re still sound asleep at the time, dreaming of your next stamp collection. </p><p>�����It is currently unknown if starters submitted while the Storytelling is ongoing are accepted or at least saved for consideration once the story ends, so it�s best to submit after the conclusion. </p><p>�����Now that you know the �when�, it�s time to delve into the �what�, as in �what in Neopia do I even write for a starter?� And that�s another very good question.</p><p>�����<b>Really, what do I write?</b></p><p>�����The short answer is �anything within the rules, as stated in the handy dandy Frequently Asked Questions in the Storytelling page�, which is apparently not that short an answer after all.</p><p>�����Since we�re only talking about beginnings, think of a story idea, write it the way you would normally create a complete story, but only write how it starts, and stop at a good cliffhanger or hook for someone else to continue it. Introduce a plot, but just enough of it to get other users thinking of what should happen next. Introduce one or two characters and what they�re up to when the story starts. </p><p>�����If you�re stumped, look at upcoming or ongoing Neopian holidays for inspiration, as there are times when themed Storytelling beginnings are introduced for the occasion. For example, you can write a spooky starter about Edna or the Esophagor for Halloween, or a Poogle Racing story for Poogle Day. </p><p>�����As for characters, you can either pick from existing site characters, or make up your own the way the previous Storytelling judge did. There�s not much in the way of characterization to be done since you�re not the only one who will be telling the story and developing the characters, but you do need to show just enough of their personality for other users to have a grasp of how to write them for the next parts. Are they angry when we first meet them? Or are they facing a moral dilemma? Maybe they were on vacation and are about to be rudely disturbed by the next Storytelling part. </p><p>�����Remember that with several users eager to continue your story, your starter should have that potential to go in many possible directions. When you write your hook, write it in such a way that the next author will be able to use it as a springboard to continue the story or add an interesting new element. Don�t try to restrict it or drop hints about what you want for it as though you want to control the flow of the story; this is the part where you must let go of your idea and pass the ball on, so to speak, to someone else. </p><p>�����Neopets is a gold mine of lore and inspiration, so just wandering Neopia and all the features and areas it has to offer is sure to give you an idea of what to do. Step away from your Storytelling tab for a while and do your dailies, play some games, look around the various Neopian lands, and you�re sure to find something that might make a good story.</p><p>�����I assume I don�t have to mention the part where you need to check your grammar and spelling. But I will mention the part where you should read through your entry once you�ve put it together to make sure it flows consistently and has everything you need, which I mentioned a few paragraphs back � and so you can catch any pesky typos or paragraphs that you could have sworn you erased a moment ago. </p><p>�����Once you�re done, you got your plot, your characters, your setting, and the sweet spot where you�ll stop and let other users continue your story, throw it all into the text box and hit the �Submit� button. Then the waiting game for your Storytelling acceptance Neomail (and your trophy and prize) begins.</p><p>�����<b>Wait, wait, it�s still not helping!</b></p><p>�����Yeah, I get it, I get it. Sometimes inspiration is too fickle. </p><p>�����For (more) inspiration, thumb back through previous Storytelling Competitions, especially those wherein the judge wrote the starter. Those have no indicated username but do have various �titles� to indicate the author like �Consternation! Uproar!� or �Going Off Course� where the username ought to be. Take note of how the starter is structured � you have the setting, the characters, the seed of a story that�s waiting to grow, and the hook for someone else to continue where you have left off which instantly draws interest and attention. More importantly, take note of the wide array of genres, moods and themes used across the years � fantasy, science fiction, drama, heroes and villains, slice of life, intrigue, magic, and more. The possibilities are endless. Well, almost endless, considering these stories all have to take place in Neopia�s universe.</p><p>�����The former Storytelling judge always had a particular style of writing, but since users are now in charge of starting new Storytelling Competitions, the style and length of each starter can differ greatly, which may or may not have an impact on the direction the story takes. Because of that, there are no hard and fast rules on style or length, but a good rule of thumb for length is to watch the size of your scroll bar in the text box where you submit entries. When your scroll bar is about the size of your cursor, that�s a good length, which means you likely have enough content for a proper Storytelling starter by then. As for style, it�s your call � just keep proper grammar and spelling in mind and make sure you have everything you need for a starter. </p><p>�����<b>I did everything this article told me, but I wasn�t picked. What did I do wrong?</b></p><p>�����With Flash gone, site events postponed and plots a thing of the past, there is less to do on Neopets compared to years long gone. More users are trying new things, which includes entering the Storytelling Competition. Even with less, ahem, competition, there are still several users who submit starters, and only one can be selected each week.</p><p>�����If you don�t get your Storytelling acceptance Neomail at the beginning of the week, go back through your entry if you can, and see if you missed some grammar or spelling errors, or perhaps some inconsistencies. If that�s the case, edit your entry and try again another week, and see if you can also enter it in a week with a Neopian holiday that fits your theme. </p><p>�����But if you didn�t find any errors � or if you failed to save the beginning for future reference � try to submit it again (well, as much of it as you can remember and write down) after the current Storytelling. From personal experience, I�ve had some starters that didn�t make the cut at first but were accepted one or two weeks later after a little refurbishing. </p><p>�����Most importantly, don�t give up � the STC is a very tough contest to win, and even veterans have their off-days (or off-weeks). </p><p>�����Writing Storytelling starters is an alternate way to participate in the competition and may be easier than continuing what other users have written, since you will have full control over what will happen, at least, for a few paragraphs. It�s also fun to see what your fellow authors try to come up with and how they end your story, which is like the icing on the cake. </p><p>�����So, what are you waiting for? Get out there and start a new story; we�re waiting to continue it! </p>"

      "Piece": "Who else has found themselves having the nearly irresistible urge to visit some of Neopia�s darker worlds? It�s that time of year again when the normally desolate Haunted Woods, Deserted Fairground and Neovia are bustling with neopets from all over Neopia. Despite their trepidation, many neopets still venture over to hunt for ghosts while others want to sample some of the spooky delights only found at the Fairground. There�s just something about this month that bring out everyone�s spooky sides.<p>�����If this is your first trip out to these spooky places, you are in the right place. This article will give you all the knowledge and safety tips to have a fun, spooky time, whether you are exploring the woods, hanging out at the fairgrounds, or buying some goodies from the marketplace. The Haunted Woods may look foreboding, but there is always fun to be found. Just read my article to help you plan your next perfect spooky trip!</p><p>�����The Haunted Woods:</p><p>�����One must first venture through the Haunted Woods in order to make it to the Deserted Fairgrounds or Neovia. It is an eerie place, home to some of Neopia�s more unique characters. Ghost neopets wander amongst the trees and every now and then a monstrous Mutant or Halloween neopet can be spotted! There are also a few residents who offer up quests to those who are willing, a haunted house, a castle and even a graveyard!</p><p>�����I know many neopets, like myself, enjoy completing a quest or two. The Haunted Woods is home to three different quests, the Brain Tree, Esophagor, and Edna. These are not your normal quests though, so read on so you don�t find yourself wandering aimlessly. </p><p>�����The Brain Tree is a fascinating resident of the Haunted Woods. It is believed that he has grown there since the beginning of time itself! He seeks knowledge that only the Esophagor can provide which means to complete a Brain Tree quest, you must complete a couple of Esophagor quests as well. Be careful though, the Esophagor will only award you knowledge when you have first started a brain tree quest. How else is he supposed to know what questions to answer?</p><p>�����The Esophagor is a strange creature with an insatiable appetite and if you agree to fetch him some food, he will gift you either an answer to one of the Brain Trees questions or an item. Each quest will provide a new answer, so you must complete multiple quests for the Esophagor in order to receive all the answers the Brain Tree seeks. Once you get all the answers needed from the Esophagor, you can complete your Brain Tree quest and receive a petpet or some special battledome equipment for your troubles. </p><p>�����If you are still feeling up to it, there is a 3rd quest you can seek out at the Witches Tower. A witch named Edna lives up there and she�s always struggled with her spells, but she just needs someone to help her obtain the right ingredients. Whether she is evil or not is up for debate and she certainly isn�t very kind, so don�t expect any kind words from her. It�s really an enter her lair at your own risk kind of place. However, if you are feeling up to the task, Edna will reward you with a small sum of neopoints and a Spooky Treat. Sometimes, she even rewards you with an avatar!</p><p>�����When you are finished questing, there is a Wanderer�s Camp located in the woods. It is home to vagabonds who enjoy telling scary stories around the campfire. If you want to learn a little about the legends surrounding the Haunted Woods, this is the best place to hear them. You can learn about poor Brutus and the curse that plagued Neovia. I would be surprised if you did not hear these stories as they are the Wanderers favourite to recite. After you finish hearing stories, follow the eerie path at the edge of the camp. This will take you to Neovia itself. It�s okay, the curse is only a legend after all.</p><p>�����Neovia:</p><p>����� Neovia was once home to an exiled aristocratic family who practised dark magic. They had a majestic mansion with a town built around it. The curse that was rumoured to have occurred was caused by this very family. Their mansion was burnt down and it took ten years before new residents were able to rebuild the town. Unlike the Deserted Fairgrounds and Haunted Woods, the streets are lit up and clean from cobwebs. It is hard to imagine what horrors occurred here. Neovia is now home to a variety of shops where one can shop to their heart's content. The architecture resembles that of Victorian styled buildings which is a striking contrast when compared to its surroundings.</p><p>�����My favourite shops to visit are The Crumpetmonger, Neovian Printing Press, and Prigpants &amp; Swolthy, Tailors. The treats at The Crumpetmonger are simply delicious � I highly recommend trying one of their many scrumptious scones. They serve such a variety that I am still attempting to sample all of them! I haven�t found one that I don�t like yet. After grabbing a scone, head on over to the Neovian Printing Press. This bookstore has one of the best variety of books I have seen. They have everything from poetry to news from all across Neopia. Any neopet can find something that piques their interest. But of course, the trip would not be complete without shopping for some Victorian styled garments at Prigpants &amp; Swolthy, Tailors. I�ve picked up some beautiful dresses and hats for my neopets to wear. Once you are done shopping, what better way to end the day than to head on over to the Deserted Fairgrounds.</p><p>�����The Deserted Fairgrounds:</p><p>�����The Deserted Fairgrounds were one of the first fairgrounds ever built in Neopia. The fairgrounds were bustling and full of life, with all types of neopets crowding the walkways. Carnival games were in no short supply and the rides were a thrill. Now, the grounds lay nearly abandoned most of the year with few neopets brave enough to enter. Cobwebs and dust have altered the grounds into an ominously sinister place. It�s hard to imagine this place full of neopets. Despite the foreboding nature of the fairgrounds though, there are still many fun games and unique foods to try out.</p><p>����� If you want to see how strong (or lucky) you are, walk on over to Arnold at the Test your Strength booth. Arnold says his game isn�t rigged, but I�ve seen some strong neopets make some wimpy scores. Regardless, you have to make sure to bring at least 100 neopoints to play. Arnold doesn�t like neopets trying to play for free. How else would he have such awesome prizes? Most of the prizes are some variety of peculiar foods that can be found at the Spooky Foods booth, but if you are lucky enough, you may find yourself in possession of a rare Halloween Paint Brush. </p><p>�����Speaking of the Spooky Foods Booth, you must try some of their treats. The food is anything but ordinary, and many might call it gross, but it wouldn�t be a trip to the Deserted Fairgrounds without trying one of the treats. As they say, if it croaks, flaps, or slithers, chances are you can buy it at Spooky Food. You can�t knock it until you try it. Although, for those less adventurous neopets you can try some of their more normal treats like pumpkin cookies or pumpkin pie.</p><p>�����The visit to the fairgrounds wouldn�t be complete without trying your hand at Coconut Shy run by Leeroy the Quiggle. This too costs 100 neopoints per throw. Many people also accuse Leeroy of rigging the game, but neopets have been known to knock a coconut over on rare occasions. If you manage to knock one of the coconuts over, you will be gifted a hefty 10,000 neopoints, an avatar, and an evil coconut! Even knocking one hard enough to move it will award you a small prize.</p><p>�����If you still have some neopoints left to spend and some time to kill, stop on by the Deserted Fairground Kiosk and visit Sidney. For 1,200 neopoints, you can try your luck and see if you can win the jackpot! Even if you don�t win the jackpot, you can still win either a small pot of neopoints ranging from 3,000 to 10,000 neopoints or some spooky food. When you finish up at the Fairgrounds, you�ll have to go through the Haunted Woods to get back home. </p><p>�����What did I tell you? The Haunted Woods, Neovia, and Deserted Fairgrounds have so much to offer, especially now during their peak season. If you feel brave enough to visit, I�d love to hear what your favourite part was!</p><p>����� </p>"

      "Desc": "A carefully curated list of the 15 most marvellous marble pets!",
      "Filename": "585490",
      "Piece": "I�ve always liked Marble Neopets, with all the nostalgia they bring. As a kid I grew up playing with marbles in the neighbourhood with my cousins and schoolmates, and seeing all those pets with different Marble colours and patterns sure brought back lots of memories of simpler, better times.<p>�����It�s been more than three years since the Marble Paint Brush was released in Y19, its description being: This Paint Brush will make your pet look sleek and shiny just like Marble! No more specifics or explanation, with the Marble Neopets mostly shaped after the spherical toys we played with, but with the release of the marvellous Marble Draik that took a totally different direction into actual marble slabs, I decided to take another look at all the Marbles, and despite all nineteen of them being great looking, I will talk about my top fifteen, in order of their release:</p><p>�����1. Elephante </p><p>�����Released: February 23, 2017 </p><p>����� </p><center><img src=//pets.neopets.com/cp/45vjsr6v/1/2.png></center><p>�����Being the first Marble Neopet ever revealed, it has more of a �solid� colour and less transparent look but still looking glassy, the Marble Elephant�s humongous body allows more space for decoration. Multiple greenish yellow stripes run across the face and body of the Elephante, with several notches that indicate multiple usages, as if it�s been actually played with. The head piece (also called hat) looks separate from the rest of the Elephante though. The Neopets that followed started looking a bit different as the colour evolved and changed over time.</p><p>�����2. Shoyru </p><p>�����Released: Shoyru Day - April 03, 2017 </p><p>����� </p><center><img src=//pets.neopets.com/cp/kzsmzmwk/1/2.png></center><p>�����A rather realistic toy marble look-alike. Since Shoyru is an air-borne Neopet, the blue colour is perfect for blending in while soaring in the skies, and the orange stripes mimic the flying nature of the Shoyru, looking like sleek, flowing, streamlined lines. </p><p>�����3. Ixi </p><p>�����Released: Ixi Day - July 11, 2017 </p><p>����� </p><center><img src=//pets.neopets.com/cp/vdqmld48/1/2.png></center><p>�����The Marble Ixi stands out by being the only one with this greenish-brownish colour that�s closer to being golden, with unique yellow, orange spots instead of the usual stripes or swirls. It almost looks like a prize that came out of a cereal box or a gumball machine.</p><p>�����4. Koi </p><p>�����Released: Koi Day - May 25, 2017 </p><p>����� </p><center><img src=//pets.neopets.com/cp/kmqn67ff/1/2.png></center><p>�����Another one that�s very close to real marble toys, mainly because of its roundish body shape, and is actually the closest in shape and colour to the Shoyru. Its premium colour is aqua-blue, which goes well with its marine nature in case a quick camouflage is needed, adorned with three stripes of red, yellow and blue which go in a circle around its body until they become fine strands on its tail. </p><p>�����5. Techo </p><p>�����Released: Techo Day - September 13, 2017 </p><p>�����</p><center><img src=\"//pets.neopets.com/cp/3t42mn3s/1/2.png \"></center><p>�����Techos are amphibians, thus green was an obvious choice for Marble. It�s almost all green, with subtle different green hues and a lighter shade of stripes that it almost looks camouflage. </p><p>�����6. Gnorbu </p><p>�����Released: Gnorbu Day - January 08, 2018 </p><p>����� </p><center><img src=//pets.neopets.com/cp/zzq479h4/1/2.png></center><p>�����The Marble Gnorbu is definitely one of a kind. Its unique monotonous purple colour (even the mane) is only highlighted by floating blobs or globules that are a lighter shade of the same colour, found mainly inside its body and limbs. This gives it the appearance of a �lava lamp�, without being luminescent. </p><p>�����7. Chia </p><p>�����Released: February 19, 2018 </p><p>����� </p><center><img src=//pets.neopets.com/cp/s485lljv/1/2.png></center><p>�����Hues of green and orange swirls make up this marvellous Marble Chia, which may be a standard colour for marbles. But what really distinguishes it from the rest, are the tufts of hair that look like glass bulbs or lamps on top of its head. </p><p>�����8. Grundo </p><p>�����Released: Grundo Independence Day - August 24, 2018 </p><p>����� </p><center><img src=//pets.neopets.com/cp/mo5v7z2h/1/2.png></center><p>�����The only red one, the Marble Grundo is very sleek-looking. The colour is solid, with ever so slight variations, mostly seen in the lighter-hued stripes, and their naturally red eyes blend it with the rest of the body. Overall, the look is futuristic and very fitting for the alien Grundos, who come from Outer Space.</p><p>�����9. Skeith </p><p>�����Released: Skeith Day - September 26, 2018 </p><p>����� </p><center><img src=//pets.neopets.com/cp/hfnlh27k/1/2.png></center><p>�����Back to the classic marble toy, but with darker tones. You might not notice it at first glance, but the blue round body of the navy blue Skeith contains lighter-hued swirls of blue-green, thus giving it a somehow aquatic vibe. Nonetheless, it�s very distinct from its Water and Maraquan counterparts.</p><p>�����10. Mynci </p><p>�����Released: Mynci Day - February 23, 2019 </p><p>����� </p><center><img src=//pets.neopets.com/cp/flwqooo9/1/2.png></center><p>�����Yet another classic. Similar to the Chia and Techo, the Mynci looks like a typical Marble spherical toy, especially with its round head, body and small limbs. </p><p>�����11. Meerca </p><p>�����Released on Meerca Day - August 20, 2019 </p><p>����� </p><center><img src=//pets.neopets.com/cp/km9kxh4s/1/2.png></center><p>�����The closest to a real marble toy, whether in shape, texture or colours. Round, shiny, mostly purple with different coloured streaks. It looks like it�s made of glass, but still retain the beady eyes. Be careful as the tail looks really fragile. It may be not the easiest to customize, but it holds its own very well against a darker background. </p><p>�����12. Zafara </p><p>�����Released: Zafara Day - February 04, 2020 </p><p>����� </p><center><img src=//pets.neopets.com/cp/qg669wtb/1/2.png></center><p>�����Taking after the �glassy� look again, the Marble Zafara leans towards a bolder colour, pink. Dark blue stripes complement the look without clashing much, due to the fact they�re adorned with purplish and lighter pink stripes as well. The hair and end-tail of the Marble Zafara are delicate and should be handled with care.</p><p>�����13. Lupe </p><p>�����Released: Lupe Day - May 05, 2020 </p><p>����� </p><center><img src=//pets.neopets.com/cp/nxqfttrg/1/2.png></center><p>�����One of a few Neopets that don�t look like an actual marble toy, and it�s a huge step forward for this colour. Blue body with purple stripes all over and yellow-orange eyes that stand out, it is modelled after the Cheshire cat, the Marble Lupe is a wonderful addition to Marble Pets. One can�t but notice that the Lupe hair tufts are smoothed out.</p><p>����� 14. Draik </p><p>�����Released: Draik Day - September 10, 2020 </p><p>����� </p><center><img src=//pets.neopets.com/cp/3c9md2oc/1/2.png></center><p>�����Finally! The one Neopet that inspired me to write this article. It was such a pleasant surprise to see Marble pets make this transition, and with none other than one of the most popular species, the Draik. The Marble Draik is modelled after Portoro: a high-end black crystalline marble. The intense jet colour of its base contains a large number of dynamic golden veins and white effervescences that seem to be in motion.</p><p>�����This exclusive natural stone is the most expensive black marble in the world.</p><p>�����It simply makes the Draik look like it�s just out of a molten golden lake, and it doesn�t need much customization to look marvellous!! </p><p>�����15. Nimmo </p><p>����� </p><center><img src=//pets.neopets.com/cp/qvn275tc/1/2.png></center><p>�����Released: Nimmo Day - June 16, 2021</p><p>�����The latest addition to Marble pets. Taking after the Draik, the Marble Nimmo is less extravagant and exorbitant with its grey colour, but still shiny as it resembles Pacific Grey Marble which captures light, making it a good unmuted stone-based colour. </p><p>�����This doesn�t mean that the other four colours aren�t good (Bori, Kougra, Lutari and Shoyru,) they just didn�t take my breath away. Other pets I would love to see painted Marble are Blumaroo, Kacheek, Eyrie and Hissi, to name a few. </p><p>����� *** BONUS*** </p><p>�����16. Grarrl </p><p>�����</p><center><img src=\"//pets.neopets.com/cp/bz8ln82s/1/4.png \"></center><p>�����Released: Grarrl Day - October 4, 2021 </p><p>�����This colour was released while I was literally ending this article, so I opted to include it, especially that it�s really unique and different. It doesn�t follow the above mentioned patterns (marble sphere toys and marble slates) even though it leans a bit towards the latter.</p><p>�����The first glance reveals a purple Grarrl that looks a little bit like Oil Paint or Dimensional, with little spirals that look like constellations. But upon further examination, these are actually FOSSILS. Brilliant idea! Grarrls come from Tyrannia, which is a pre-historic land. It makes sense that the Marble Grarrl is an ancient stone that contains fossilized ammonites! And it�s just been unearthed for the whole world to see. </p><p>����� If you enjoyed my overlook on Marble pets, I�ll try to review more colours in upcoming Neopian Times issues!</p><p>����� </p>"

Don't forget to equip any new weapons/armour that are dropped by enemies/bosses as you are going along as well!</p><p>�����I also recommend using the lowest healing potions first after battles to top up health, they will be pretty much useless during later battles so there is no point saving them.</p><p>�����While battling I would suggest always targeting the same enemy until it is knocked out. Less enemies in the battle means you'll take less damage.</p><p>�����Don't sell the Father's Sword, it will be helpful to you later in the game.</p><p>�����One final point! Be careful and check who you are attacking with, some weapons will give skills such as Rohane's Combat Focus and when that shows up on the right of the battle screen it's very easy to mistake it for Mipsy's Direct Damage and click it accidentally if you aren't paying attention, wasting a turn.</p><p>����� That's all I have to say for now, so let's get on with the guide!</p><p>����� Skills</p><p>�����The Lost Desert section of Neoquest 2 starts you off in Sakhmet City. By this point, you should be around Level 31 and your stats should look like this:</p><p>�����Rohane:</p><p>�����Critical Attacks 8: Raging Force</p><p>�����Damage Increase 11: Flawless Balance</p><p>�����Stunning Strikes 2: Startle</p><p>�����Innate Magic Resistance 2: Magic Resistance II</p><p>�����Innate Melee Haste 7: Lithe Agility I</p><p>�����Mipsy:</p><p>�����Direct Damage 11: Vaporize</p><p>�����Innate Melee Defense 8: Diversion II</p><p>�����Innate Casting Haste 11: Agile Conjuration II</p><p>�����Talinia:</p><p>�����Increased Bow Damage 10: Strong Bow</p><p>�����Multiple Targets 5: Double Shot</p><p>�����Shockwave 4: Awful Story</p><p>�����Innate Melee Haste 11: Flowing Steps II</p><p>����� As you level up you should continue building up these stats evenly and I will be periodically listing what your stats should be so you know roughly where you should be stat wise.</p><p>����� Sakhmet City</p><p>�����Head out of the city and into the tents to rest, stock up on potions and purchase new weapons/armour. If the damage/defence is only 1 higher than your current equipment I suggest not buying it, it's better to save your money.</p><p>�����Equip any better weapons/armour you may have picked up on your way here and sell the rest since you no longer need them.</p><p>�����I usually make sure I'm maxed out on all of the healing potions available to buy, pick up at least 1-2 Resurrect potions and 10 Scorch Potions.</p><p>�����You should have plenty of Gold to purchase everything you need so when you're done leave the tents and head NorthEast to the Temple of the Sky.</p><p>����� Temple of the Sky</p><p>�����After entering the Temple, head forward to the gardens then left to the end of the hallway and up the stairs in the last room.</p><p>�����On the next floor you need to head down and follow the corridor right and down, heading into the room on the right. Loop around the central room then follow the next corridor left then head up into the central room where you can finally take on Siliclast. After he is defeated, head through the portal to be taken back to Sakhmet City.</p><p>�����Right now you should be at around Level 34 and your stats should be close to this:</p><p>�����Rohane:</p><p>�����Critical Attacks 10: Crushing Impact</p><p>�����Damage Increase 11: Flawless Balance</p><p>�����Stunning Strikes 3: Daunt</p><p>�����Innate Magic Resistance 3: Magic Resistance III</p><p>�����Innate Melee Haste 8: Lithe Agility II</p><p>�����Mipsy:</p><p>�����Direct Damage 12: Destroy</p><p>�����Innate Melee Defense 10: Nimbleness I</p><p>�����Innate Casting Haste 11: Agile Conjuration II</p><p>�����Talinia:</p><p>�����Increased Bow Damage 11: Oaken Calm</p><p>�����Multiple Targets 6: Third Arrow</p><p>�����Shockwave 6: Ill Omen</p><p>�����Innate Melee Haste 11: Flowing Steps II</p><p>����� Head back out of the city and once again rest and stock up on potions at the tents before making your way to the far North where the Ruined Temple lies. </p><p>����� Ruined Temple</p><p>�����The first floor is pretty straight forward, just head up then follow the corridor left and up to take the stairs in the top left corner up to the next floor.</p><p>�����On the next floor you need to weave your way down the corridor to the bottom, move over to the right and up through the tables and chairs and then finally go up to the top right corner where the stairs are.</p><p>�����The third floor has you making your way back over to the top left where yet another staircase awaits you. Head down then follow the hallway left and up. Weave your way down through the barrels and boxes in this room, then follow the corridor left and up to reach the room with the stairs.</p><p>�����Finally you've reached the last floor. Head down and take out Gebarn II then head through the portal to be taken back to Sakhmet City once again.</p><p>�����You should be around Level 38 by this point and building your stats up evenly.</p><p>�����Head back out of the city again and rest and stock up on potions at the tents. Head to the far North again going past the Ruined Temple this time.</p><p>�����As you get closer to Waset Village the enemies should stop giving you experience so feel free to switch from Hunting to Normal. Any battles you do encounter you can run from but make sure to keep your health topped up if you fail the Flee and take damage.</p><p>�����Don't forget to switch back to Hunting when you reach the Village.</p><p>����� Waset Village</p><p>�����Waset Village consists of more tents, rest up, stock up on potions and buy any weapons/armour you need.</p><p>�����Make sure you pick up Velm while you are here, he is the final member of your team and a much needed healer.</p><p>�����You shouldn't need to use many potions from this point on as long as you keep your health topped up with Velm's Group Healing but I still recommend buying them just in case, it's better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>�����Again I make sure I'm maxed out on all of the healing potions available to buy, pick up at least 1-2 Resurrect potions and max out Blister Potions.</p><p>�����With Velm added to your team, let's take a look at our stats, they should be pretty close to the following:</p><p>�����Rohane:</p><p>�����Critical Attacks 10: Crushing Impact</p><p>�����Damage Increase 11: Flawless Balance</p><p>�����Stunning Strikes 3: Daunt</p><p>�����Innate Magic Resistance 3: Magic Resistance III</p><p>�����Innate Melee Haste 8: Lithe Agility II</p><p>�����Mipsy:</p><p>�����Direct Damage 13: Eradicate</p><p>�����Innate Melee Defense 11: Nimbleness II</p><p>�����Innate Casting Haste 12: Agile Conjuration III</p><p>�����Talinia:</p><p>�����Increased Bow Damage 12: Placid Waters</p><p>�����Multiple Targets 7: Rapid Draw</p><p>�����Shockwave 7: Grim News</p><p>�����Innate Melee Haste 12: Flowing Steps III</p><p>�����Velm:</p><p>�����Group Healing 10: Mitigation</p><p>�����Celestial Hammer 9: Apprentice Blacksmith</p><p>�����Innate Melee Defense 8: Diversion II</p><p>�����Innate Casting Haste 9: Swift Summoning III</p><p>����� Now you have Velm I would suggest targeting the enemy that will attack next, especially with Velm's Celestial Hammer (unless you need to heal, always make healing a priority). If you can pull off a few stuns the enemies will be unable to get any attacks in, which is a huge health saver.</p><p>�����When you've spent Velm's points and bought everything you need, leave the tents and head East to the Valley of Kings.</p><p>�����The Palace is located SouthWest of the entrance to the Valley of Kings, work your way over there and head on in.</p><p>����� Palace of Ancient Kings</p><p>�����When you enter, head North then West past the water then NorthWest to the corner room and stand on the left bed to access a secret staircase.</p><p>�����Weave your way through the boxes to the room exit in the top right then head up through the cave to reach The Revenant. I like to focus on attacking only him since when you defeat him the Skeletons are defeated too. Take him out and then make sure you speak to Lifira completely before heading through the portal back to the Valley of Kings.</p><p>�����Head back NorthEast out of the Valley and head back to Waset Village. Rest, stock up on potions and speak to Lifira completely again, then leave the Village.</p><p>�����Go far North then West and speak to Bukaru who will tell you how to find the 2nd Medallion Piece. Make sure you talked to Lifira completely both times or he won't tell you where it is.</p><p>�����Go up until you hit the rocks then follow them around East until you get to the Medallion Piece and pick it up.</p><p>�����After picking up the 2nd Medallion Piece head East and then South and loop back around past Bledynn to get to Akhten-Ka.</p><p>�����Right now you should be at around Level 41 and your stats should be close to this:</p><p>�����Rohane:</p><p>�����Critical Attacks 11: Destructive Impact</p><p>�����Damage Increase 12: Transcendent Grace</p><p>�����Stunning Strikes 4: Intimidate</p><p>�����Innate Magic Resistance 4: Magical Protection I</p><p>�����Innate Melee Haste 9: Lithe Agility III</p><p>�����Mipsy:</p><p>�����Direct Damage 14: Disintegrate</p><p>�����Innate Melee Defense 12: Nimbleness III</p><p>�����Innate Casting Haste 13: Battle Voice I</p><p>�����Talinia:</p><p>�����Increased Bow Damage 13: Still Pond</p><p>�����Multiple Targets 8: Trinity Barrage</p><p>�����Shockwave 8: Dire Warning</p><p>�����Innate Melee Haste 13: Battle Dance I</p><p>�����Velm:</p><p>�����Group Healing 11: Restoration</p><p>�����Celestial Hammer 11: Journeyman Blacksmith</p><p>�����Innate Melee Defense 10: Nimbleness I</p><p>�����Innate Casting Haste 11: Agile Conjuration II</p><p>����� Akhten-Ka</p><p>�����This area is pretty straight forward with only one floor. Head to the room in the top left and take down Coltzan's Ghost. When he is defeated, pick up the Medallion Piece in the barrel behind him and backtrack to Bledynn.</p><p>�����From Bledynn work your way around and back up and pick up the Medallion Gemstone hidden in the rock pattern to the North.</p><p>�����Now go all the way back to the Ruined Temple and head SouthWest to the Pyramid.</p><p>�����Once again you can stop by Waset Village if you need to rest and stock up on potions but you shouldn't need to if you've been keeping your health topped up using Velm's Group Healing.</p><p>�����As you get closer to Waset Village the enemies should stop giving you experience so feel free to switch from Hunting to Normal. Any battles you do encounter you can run from but make sure to keep your health topped up if you fail the Flee and take damage.</p><p>�����Don't forget to switch back to Hunting when you reach the Pyramid.</p><p>����� Zakharukh's Pyramid</p><p>�����To get to the next floor you need to head up then move around in a giant S towards the bottom left and finally head up to find the stairs.</p><p>�����On this floor head down then right to the gap in the wall to the north. Make your way to either gap on the left or right then go to the center where the stairs await.</p><p>�����Head up to take down Anubits and that's all of the Lost Desert taken care of.</p><p>�����Right now you should be at around Level 44 and your stats should be close to this:</p><p>�����Rohane:</p><p>�����Critical Attacks 12: Devastating Impact</p><p>�����Damage Increase 13: Swordmaster</p><p>�����Stunning Strikes 5: Surprise</p><p>�����Innate Magic Resistance 5: Magical Protection II</p><p>�����Innate Melee Haste 10: Flowing Steps I</p><p>�����Mipsy:</p><p>�����Direct Damage 15: Obliterate</p><p>�����Innate Melee Defense 14: Finesse II</p><p>�����Innate Casting Haste 15: Battle Voice III</p><p>�����Talinia:</p><p>�����Increased Bow Damage 14: Rock Steady</p><p>�����Multiple Targets 9: Cluster Shot</p><p>�����Shockwave 9: Shocking Information</p><p>�����Innate Melee Haste 14: Battle Dance II</p><p>�����Velm:</p><p>�����Group Healing 11: Restoration</p><p>�����Celestial Hammer 11: Journeyman Blacksmith</p><p>�����Innate Melee Defense 10: Nimbleness I</p><p>�����Innate Casting Haste 11: Agile Conjuration II</p><p>����� Congratulations on beating the Lost Desert section of Neoquest 2.

      "Piece": "<font size=5>T</font>he Halloween Ruki found herself standing in the middle of her parlour, a broom in her hands. Her antennae were flicked backwards and her beautiful grey eyes were narrowed in disgust. She was surrounded by Korbats that she had considered her friends up until that moment. All of them were collapsed around the room, having gorged themselves on the food that she had painstakingly prepared that day. Looking around at the ravages of a party gone wrong, the only thing that the Ruki could think was that her day was not supposed to end like this.<p>�����~ ~ ~ </p><p>����� It was Korbat Day.</p><p>����� Althea had big plans for this day. Living in the Haunted Woods, she had several Korbats for friends and the kind-hearted Ruki had decided to do something for them. She was going to throw her first ever party. Not only to celebrate their special day but to celebrate the relationship that she had with each of them. In order to do that of course, she had planned on waking up early in order to get things started. </p><p>����� Though, for some unexplained reason, Althea�s alarm clock didn�t go off. She was sleeping soundly in her bed and perhaps would have stayed there for far, far too long if it hadn�t been for Tully, her faerie Chezzoom. Her Petpet scampered along the length of her body, startling the Ruki awake. She sat bolt upright in bed with a gasp. The sun was out and she knew she had woken up late. </p><p>����� A glance at the clock confirmed Althea�s fear. </p><p>����� �Nine o�clock!� The Ruki wailed, trying to move quickly and ended up getting herself tangled in her blankets, falling out of bed in the process.</p><p>����� Now an undignified heap on the floor, Althea forced herself to calm down while Tully hovered anxiously around her. </p><p>����� �I�m fine, Tully.� The Ruki reassured her Chezzoom who squeaked in reply. </p><p>����� Althea found her feet, tossing her blankets onto her bed before heading straight to her kitchen. As a professional baker, she absolutely loved to bake and had a list a mile long of goodies she was going to make that day. Unfortunately, she had to cross a few items off because she no longer had the extra hours she had hoped to have. With a large guest list, she knew she would be busier than ever before in order to get everything done. Not only did she have to bake but she also had to decorate for the party!</p><p>����� Already, Althea felt she had bitten off more than she could chew. She wasn�t sure if she would have time to get all of it done. So, she decided to just get to work. She brought out her kitchen supplies, calculating a hundred things in the process. Amongst everything else there were fresh apples, an assortment of berries, potatoes, pumpkin, butter, milk and flour. </p><p>����� The Ruki began working the dough, lots and lots of dough. Althea loved baking for several reasons: it was hands on, messy and the finished product could be eaten. Not to mention, no one could resist the lovely smells wafting from the oven that spread throughout the house. She was doing work that suited her and she was lost in the zone.</p><p>����� Althea was making two types of pies: beef and potato. The beef stew and the gravy got started on the stove and she chopped the potatoes into healthy chunks. With that out of the way, she began on the crust. As far as baking went, pies were her favourite. There was so much variety, not just the filling but the crust too. No one could resist her pies. </p><p>����� Including a certain faerie Chezzoom.</p><p>����� Setting the finished pies on the counter to cool, Althea looked sternly at Tully fluttering around the kitchen. �These are not for you. These are for the party later. Do not touch these pies.�</p><p>����� Tully looked innocently at Althea, her pale blue nose twitching like mad. She respected and loved her owner, especially her baking. The Ruki usually gave her Chezzoom tidbits or even baked her treats and as a result, Tully didn�t beg. Unfortunately, there was nothing like that today. The supplies were limited and the Ruki just didn�t have time for her Petpet. </p><p>����� Without much choice but to trust that Tully would behave, Althea got to work on the Korbat Grave Cake that would be the main dessert served at the party. Naturally cheerful, she always put her heart into everything that she did. There were three elements to a Korbat Grave Cake: sponge cake, chocolate cake and gummy Korbat tails. With all of her friends in mind, the Ruki made the cake larger than it normally was made. This was actually her first attempt at making this kind of cake and the only thing that gave her pause was the gummy Korbat tails. </p><p>����� Althea laughed at herself as she wondered how she would get the gummies to twist and curve around one another, keeping their shape as well as upright. She had to ponder this for several moments, playing with the gummy tails on the cake to test her different ideas out. Tully hovered around her, squeaking comments and not-very-helpful advice. Finally, she seemed to find something that worked. She used thin strips of wood with a small hoop that she threaded each tail through to hold it upright. </p><p>����� �There! That�s finished!� Althea smiled at Tully in satisfaction at a job well done when she glanced at the clock. The Ruki gasped. �Oh, look at the time! There�s still so much to do!� </p><p>����� The scones came next and while they were baking in the oven, Althea entered her parlour to begin decorating. Her home wasn�t really large enough for a party, now that she was looking at the limited space she had to work with. She pushed all of her furniture to the walls and brought out some tables where she would place the refreshments. She took a brief moment to get the scones out of the oven and place the tarts in. Then, she returned to the parlour to hang up the handmade banner that read Happy Korbat Day and blew up balloons, letting them drift around the room. </p><p>����� The Halloween Korbat stood in the middle of her parlour, studying the work she had done. That�s when she smelled something burning. </p><p>����� �The tarts!� With an agonized cry, Althea ran to the kitchen in the back of the house knowing she was too late. </p><p>�����The tarts were as black as charcoal. The Ruki tossed the ruined tarts into the trash. She felt like crying. She couldn�t make any more because she had run out of ingredients for them and she didn�t have time. There was only an hour left before her guests began to arrive and she still had pumpkin rolls and tombstone cupcakes to bake. </p><p>�����The time flew by. The first guest hadn�t even arrived and Althea felt tired. She had just set the last cupcake out on the table when the doorbell rang. From then on, there wasn�t a quiet moment to be found. Guests trickled in and soon the small parlour was filled to capacity. </p><p>�����For the first time in her life, Althea felt claustrophobic. Everyone else had a good time, talking and playing games while the Halloween Ruki faded into the background. She was mostly asked where the bathroom was and that the food table was running low. She felt as if she were being ignored and used. This was not the way she had imagined her first time as hostess would go.</p><p>�����The party only ended once the food ran out. </p><p>�����That�s when most of Althea�s �friends� left. Her parlour was an absolute mess with the refreshment tables mostly empty with food and drinks spilt or thrown around the room (even on the ceiling!). There were three Korbats passed out in the room, all stuffed to bursting with the food she had prepared that day. Her naturally cheerful nature had evaporated and she felt anger beginning to boil over as she grabbed a broom to begin to clean up this disaster of a party. She tried to keep it in check but every look, every sweep of the broom made things worse. </p><p>������My</p><p>�����day</p><p>�����was</p><p>�����not</p><p>�����supposed </p><p>�����to</p><p>�����end</p><p>�����like</p><p>�����THIS!�</p><p>�����Each sweep of the broom was one word and each word and each sweep became more aggressive until Althea was almost swinging the broom like a baseball bat. At �THIS�, the Ruki found that she had raised the broom high above her head and she was standing over one of the immobilized Korbats on her parlour floor. She glowered down at this so-called friend of hers. Suddenly, she couldn�t contain her anger any longer.</p><p>�����Filled with a wild urge, the Ruki gave a cry of rage. �Time to sweep the garbage OUT!�</p><p>�����Althea drew the broom back like a golf club now, prepared to strike the Korbat at her feet. However, she was stopped mid-swing by a cry of alarm. The Ruki raised her head to see Albus, shadow Korbat, looking rather taken aback at the scene he had walked into. She still felt disappointed at the way her party had turned out but the anger was beginning to fade. Slowly, she lowered the broom. </p><p>������I�ll just take that now,� Albus said, gingerly reaching out for the broom.</p><p>�����The Halloween Ruki sighed and turned away, unable to look at the shadow Korbat. �So, what are you still doing here?�</p><p>������I figured you would have a lot of work on your hands once everyone cleared out. I stayed to help you clean up.�</p><p>������I,� Althea began, half turning to look at the Korbat over her shoulder. �Thank you, Albus. As you can see, I was a little...upset.�</p><p>������Yes but that�s understandable,� Albus said with a light shrug. �I mean, who wouldn�t be upset faced with all of this?�</p><p>�����With the shadow Korbat�s understanding, the Halloween Ruki gave him a grateful look. �I don�t even know where to start.�</p><p>����� Albus smiled reassuringly at Althea. �Well, how about I get these three into a carriage and on their way home. Meanwhile, you get started on clearing the tables and the trash out. When I come back, we�ll go from there.�</p><p>�����With this plan in mind, Althea felt a little better. She was able to clear the tables and remove them from the parlour. When Albus returned, they began to clean up the food and trash littered around the room. They took down the banner and Albus took down all of the balloons gathered on the ceiling. Then, they placed all of the parlour furniture back in their proper places. </p><p>�����Finished, Althea flopped on her Fluffy Cloud Sofa with a huff. Tully had not helped but had been sleeping soundly on the back of the sofa while her owner and Albus worked. She stirred with a yawn and a stretch as her owner sat down. With a flutter of her wings, she was airborne and in Althea�s lap with a happy squeak. The Ruki was exhausted but managed to rub her Petpet�s head lightly. </p><p>�����Althea looked up to find that Albus was still there, standing in her parlour. She had expected him to leave, now that her house was now clean. She raised her eyebrows at him in a silent question. It was clear that there was something on his mind. Realizing he had her attention, he took a step forward so he was standing in front of her.</p><p>������The night is still young, Althea. Are you going straight to sleep?� the Korbat looked at the Ruki curiously.</p><p>������Bed does sound lovely. Why do you ask?� Althea was rather puzzled by Albus� question. </p><p>������I was invited to two Korbat Day parties. The second one is just about to start.� Albus paused, giving Althea a moment to collect herself before he continued. �This party is to celebrate Korbat Day but all species are invited. Though, I completely understand if you�re all partied out.�</p><p>�����Althea hesitated, thankful that Albus understood how she felt. So, she rather surprised herself with her response. �All species, huh? OK, I�ll come.�</p><p>������Great then let�s go. I�m going to hire a carriage since it�s a bit of a walk, OK?�</p><p>������Wait, it�s still in the Haunted Woods, right?� Althea was surprised by this suggestion.</p><p>�����Albus laughed at his friend�s expression. �Yes, just not in Neovia.�</p><p>�����Althea nodded and then smiled, rising to her feet as Tully flew up with a happy squeak. �To be honest, I might fall asleep in the carriage.�</p><p>������To be honest, I might join you.�</p><p>�����As she expected, Althea did nod off. Though, it was only a light snooze and she roused as the carriage finally stopped. </p><p>������A cemetery?� The Halloween Ruki had not been expecting this but she nodded her head appreciatively as they walked through the wrought-iron gates. </p><p>������Yeah, it�s great because it�s like its own little community,� Albus explained. </p><p>������It sure is.�</p><p>�����The place was swarming with Neopets and Petpets of all kinds.</p><p>������So, Albus, what do we do first?� Althea asked. </p><p>������I�d like to introduce you to the friend that invited me,� Albus said.</p><p>������Lead on, then.�</p><p>�����It wasn�t long before they were approached by a beautiful silver Korbat, a Ganuthor padding silently beside. �Albus! Glad you could make it.�</p><p>������Your sleepy little neighbourhood throws a party what, twice a year? There�s no way I�d miss this!� Albus waved a hand to indicate the activity surrounding them.</p><p>������There�s food, there�s games and company galore. Just watch out for the open graves.� The silver Korbat winked at Albus and they shared a laugh.</p><p>������Sylvie, this is Althea. She also threw a Korbat Day party and I invited her here.�</p><p>������The more the merrier! It�s usually pretty dead around here.� </p><p>�����Caught off guard by the joke, Althea laughed along with the two Korbats.</p><p>������Oh good. You can smile. You looked so very grave. Let loose, enjoy yourself! Look alive!� Sylvie gave a cheeky grin. �Now, I�ve got to continue mixing it up myself. See ya later!�</p><p>�����Althea had a bemused expression on her face as the silver Korbat left. �Sylvie, I like her.�</p><p>������I knew you would,� Albus said.</p><p>������She has this way of making others comfortable, putting them at ease.�</p><p>������Which is why I knew you�d like her. Whenever I have a bad day, I visit either you or Sylvie to cheer me right u. So, when you were down, I knew Sylvie would do the same for you.�</p><p>������It worked. I do feel better.�</p><p>������What do you want to do?�</p><p>������I�m starving. I haven�t eaten all day.�</p><p>������You�ve been around food all day,� Albus pointed out.</p><p>�����Althea huffed and gave the Korbat a wry look. �Ah, the curse of the culinary professional. You�re so busy making food that you don�t always get around to eating it.�</p><p>������Then let�s do it now!�</p><p>�����It didn�t take long for them to find the food, with Tully leading the way. They ate Korbat Pasta and Meatballs with Korbat Veggie Plate and thick slices of freshly baked bread with Skeith Juice Cocktail to drink. With no seating to be had, they gingerly leaned against a raised tomb. There was silence as they ate, too hungry for conversation. Though, there was no end of things to watch. </p><p>������It�s rather ironic isn�t it, that it could be so cheerful in a graveyard,� Althea commented, nodding her head to the happy, smiling faces all around them.</p><p>�����A gaggle of children passed by, giggling like mad, making the two friends smile too. </p><p>������It�s almost like a carnival,� Albus said. </p><p>������Yeah but a safe one,� Althea added.</p><p>�����There were several games going on and the two friends began to walk around and try them out. Not a one was exclusively for Korbats. Althea was relieved and was able to play the darts game, a whack-a-Korbat game and a fishing game, amongst others. The only game she was any good at was the whack-a-Korbat game while Albus had done well at darts. They had both failed at the fishing game.</p><p>������Well, if this isn�t humiliating, I don�t know what is,� Althea said wryly.</p><p>�����The Ruki was referring to the pair of children who had played after them and won a grand prize.</p><p>������Well, at least we still get candy,� Albus said, chewing on Gummy Korbat Tails.</p><p>������Yeah, there is that,� Althea said with a grin.</p><p>�����The night was still young-at least by Haunted Woods standards-and the party was still going strong. However, Althea could feel herself beginning to flag. Her mood was back to normal and she could forget that her bad day had ever happened. All she wanted now was to go home and get some much needed rest. She sensed that Albus felt the same way.</p><p>������Let�s find Sylvie to let her know we�re off for the night,� Albus suggested. </p><p>�����They found the silver Korbat amongst a group of zombies. When she saw them, she let the zombies stumble on without her. </p><p>������Going home before you become zombies yourselves, eh?� Sylvie guessed, looking at first Althea and then Albus sympathetically. �It�s a good idea. You already look dead on your feet. Althea, you�re welcome to visit anytime. Same for you, Albus but you already know that. Hope to see you soon.� Sylvie hugged them both in farewell.</p><p>�����Once Althea, Albus and Tully settled in their carriage, the Ruki looked at the shadow Korbat with a smile. �I had such high hopes for today. When everything went downhill, those hopes died. You revived them, Albus. In a graveyard, no less! Thank you for bringing me to that party. It was exactly what I needed.�</p><p>������What are friends for? You would have done the same for me.� Albus grinned cheekily before continuing, �Are you all partied out now?�</p><p>������Yeah,� Althea responded with a sigh.</p><p>������Next up is Halloween.�</p><p>�����Althea groaned, �Don�t remind me!�</p><p>�����<b>The End.</b> </p>"

      "Piece": "<font size=5>C</font>laude the rainbow kadoatie peeked his head out from the opening of the backpack. His owner Oohee the faerie poogle was gathering up the last of her things, before they were to set off for the day at Mystery Island!<p>�����They both were looking forward to this. Their own adventure just the two of them. The reason behind them going on this mini adventure, was because Oohee had a few friends mention just how lovely the Island was and that there were loads to do there. Plus they said she could bring Claude along with her as they allowed petpets - as long as he doesn't run off and stays with Oohee it should be fine. No problem there Oohee thought to herself. It wasn't long before Oohee booked a boat to take them there and now the day had finally arrived!</p><p>�����They arrived at Mystery Island on a sunny Tuesday morning. The boat docked at the harbour and Oohee jumped off the boat with Claude still in the backpack and made her way to the Tiki Tours as she wanted to get a good view of the whole Island first. \"Let's see what Mystery Island has in store for us today, hey Claude?\" she said, as Claude poked his head out of the backpack. When Oohee stroked the top of his head, he meowed in agreement.</p><p>�����Settling down on a seat with Claude on her lap she was given a free map guide which explained in more detail some of the attractions there. </p><p>�����They went along the coast edge of the Island and they both took in the wonderful views of Mystery Island. They passed the beach, the rock pool, a big cooking pot and a darker shadowy bit called the Lost City of Geraptiku; which she read about on her tour map. In there was a place called the Deserted Tomb and it was said that only the brave can go in there. \"We're brave aren't we, Claude?\" Oohee whispered in Claude's ear and Claude meowed in response. So they were going to set some time to go in there at some point! </p><p>�����Carrying on with the tour they passed the Island Market and the Tropical food stall which sold all sorts of delicious fruits. Claude licked his lips. He was hoping Oohee would find some time to go in there too! </p><p>�����They also passed the Tombola stall and the Tiki Tack shop before the tour came to an end. They'd seen what was round the outside of the Island now for the inside of the Island. Oohee put Claude back in her backpack but kept the zip open so Claude could poke his head out whenever he wanted and off they went.</p><p>�����Oohee fancied a few games of the Gadgadsgame so they walked over and Oohee tried her luck with the falling fruit and tried to make them bigger by matching the fruits up but the game was too quick for her and she lost. But she managed to beat her own high score so that was a plus!</p><p>�����Looking round after the game, Oohee fancied dipping her toes into the sea by the beach so that was their next stop. There was no one else around so she picked Claude up from the backpack and put him down on the sand so he could sniff and look around the surroundings. She took out her camera and took some pictures of the beach and of course of Claude jumping around in the sand. He looked ever so cute.</p><p>����� They sat down for a while to take in the views. Feeling hungry by this point, Oohee took some food out of her backpack for them both and they ate while watching the waves coming in from the sea.</p><p>�����Afterwards Oohee walked past the 3 tall rocks which she took pictures of and Claude looked up at them in awe. Past the 3 rocks, was the Cooking pot which they passed by earlier on the tour and she read from her tour map that only in the month of August you can unlock the Mystery by putting certain ingredients into the cooking pot. Unfortunately, Oohee didn't have any of the ingredients required to unlock the mystery so she took pictures of the pot instead.</p><p>�����Oohee then carried on walking around and came up to the gate that lead through to the Lost City of Gerapitku. She walked through and in the corner was the Deserted Tomb, \"Shall we?\" Oohee asked Claude who had his head poked out of the backpack and Claude nodded. They entered the deserted tomb and come face to face with a stone door. Oohee opened the stone door and gazes into the darkness. Luckily she had brought her torch along with her and proceeded through. Oohee walks along a path and reaches an empty room. It looked like someone had beaten them to it and had found the treasure! </p><p>�����Feeling a little bit disappointed that they didn't find anything, they slowly made their way back out. Blinking into the sunshine, Oohee sighed with relief and so did Claude maybe it was a tad scary in there but they did it! </p><p>�����Walking back out through the gate, Oohee walked past the training schools. \"We don't have enough time to look in there today Claude, there's so much more to look at!\" so she carried on walking, past the Island arena where they could hear whooping and cheering going on from inside and then Oohee decided to go into the Neopian Haiku Stall to see what that was all about. They were greeted by an Island Kougra who announced today's Hauki. \"Yesterday hurls 0, monolith abbreviates, enemy turns 0.\" he boldly stated smiling at Oohee. Claude looked at Oohee and Oohee looked at Claude, \"Err thanks..\" Oohee mumbled trying to not look so confused and walked back out trying to contemplate what on earth that meant...</p><p>�����Next stop was the Tiki tack store and they was greeted by the Tiki tack man himself. \"What shall we buy as a souvenir from here then, Claude?\" Oohee asked while browsing the shelves. She took Claude out the backpack so they could look together and Claude got excited over some bottled sand. In the end Oohee bought some blue sand for Claude to play around with later on. He would most likely leave footprints everywhere and for herself she wanted a surfboard keyring. She bought the items and then exited the shop. \"Shall we have a game of Volleyball, Claude?\" Oohee asked him while he nodded and meowed in agreement.</p><p>�����That was their next stop so Oohee set Claude down on the sand while Oohee played some Volleyball up against a red Mynci. He was good but Oohee was better! she won hooray! And Claude was happy for her too jumping around in the sand.</p><p>�����Oohee picked Claude up and they went over to the Tombola stand where they were almost certain it was the same guy who was at the Tiki tack stall but they couldn't be sure... She picked a raffle ticket and it was number 40 and she won a prize; a Codestone Plushie! The next number was 44 but she didn't win anything from that one.</p><p>�����By that point Oohee's backpack was getting pretty full with all the goodies she had bought so she had to let Claude walk along beside her. She did however have enough room for a couple more fruits! And that was where they were heading towards next.</p><p>�����Their last stop before it was time to head back to the harbour as the boat was going to pick them up again was the Tropical fruit shop. Claude was looking forward to this the most! They were greeted by a friendly Island Techo and bought some fruits like the Twirly fruit and the Melowhirl. They also had a couple of glasses of fresh Phearade as they were both thirsty. </p><p>�����Oohee packed the fruits into her backpack and told Claude they would share them later, on the boat back home. Then Oohee remembered something; \"Oh no Claude! We didn't have enough time to go and see what the Island Mystic hut was all about. We will definitely have to come back again sometime, won't we Claude and look around the training school as well. Plus you loved the beach didn't you?\" Oohee bent down and tickled Claude under the chin while he nodded in agreement. \"But right now it�s time to go home.\"</p><p>�����They both walked to the harbour. Climbed onto the boat and Claude fell asleep straight away next to Oohee. It had been a fun day but now they were going to have a little nap while the boat took them home.</p><p>�����<b>The End.</b> </p>"

      "Filename": "585512",
      "Piece": "<font size=5>H</font>ello, Neopian Times! I�m Skaata, interviewing Kep Bonnefie of Team Darigan Citadel. Darigan did quite well in this year's cup, ending with a podium finish, but the loyal fans anxiously await a true return to form. Let�s get the perspective of someone from the inside.<p>�����Kep: �I appreciate the fact that you waited until after the finals to ask for an interview; there are so many buffoons who pay no heed to the fact that we need to focus on our preparation and not their stupid questions.�</p><p>�����Skaata: �Ehehe, well, I hope the questions I�ve prepared pass muster! Now, let�s get it out of the way � the rumour about the Darigan Yooyus in the match with Kiko Lake. You know about it?�</p><p>�����Kep: �Erugh. Yes, I�ve heard about it. I suppose it�s good to nip it in the bud here and now, so everybody gets the message. The idea that we influence the Darigan Yooyus in our favour by whispering in some unknown demon tongue? Absolutely asinine, as you�ve probably figured out. First of all, it doesn�t make any sense � all of the Yooyus used by the Altador Cup are born and bred in Altador among their fellow Yooyus. There�s no cultural crossover between us and them at all. Secondly, if a Yooyu were found to be open to manipulation by players, they�d be kicked out of Altador Cup faster than a Kiko asking for an Altador Cup donation. That�d be a huge dishonour for any Yooyu; do you think they�d risk that kind of humiliation just to help us score a goal or two, purely because we�re both purple?�</p><p>�����Skaata: �Those are excellent points, and your integrity was never in doubt on my end. Some Yooyuball fans are utterly convinced that the match was fixed; what do you say to them?�</p><p>�����Kep: �We care about those who matter to us; ourselves, our homeland, and the fans. We honestly couldn�t care less about the opinion of some booger-licking knuckle dragger who�d rather be angry than right. It�s less stressful in the long run to ignore these kinds of people. Liberating, even. Helps us focus on the game.�</p><p>�����Skaata: \"Love the creative insults! You've consistently used an offensive formation of a balance of two offensive players and two defenders throughout your Yooyuball career- can you explain the philosophy behind that decision?\"</p><p>�����Kep: �We think it�s dumb to assume that the games will always go one way or another; anything can happen in a game as fast-paced as Yooyuball, so we design our playbook around adapting, and that�s the philosophy at the heart of any balanced formation. We can train to go after any weakness, any breaking point, and that�s exactly what we do. We don�t break the rules, but we don�t play nice, either. No quarter is given, and none is expected. We wouldn�t have it any other way.�</p><p>�����Skaata: �The results speak for themselves! Darigan Citadel�s done a lot better recently compared to a few years prior, completing the year with a fantastic podium finish, but hasn�t managed to cinch the cup a second time. What, in your opinion, is the reason for this?�</p><p>�����Kep: �It�s� difficult to say, really. Layton�s been blaming himself for it, says the buck ultimately stops with him, but I have to disagree with him, just this once. We�re a team � we share the load equally, in victory and in defeat. It�s possible that we�ve simply not shaken up the salad enough, if you catch my drift. Yooyuball as a sport is constantly evolving in terms of strategies, both new ones and older ones that fall in and out of fashion. Yes, of course we�re adaptable, and we always try to develop new strategies � we came up with some great innovations this year, and the results speak for themselves. But maybe some small piece of the puzzle is holding us back from the title and we don�t even realise it. It could be a small thing, but when the competition is this razor-sharp, any weakness can and will be used against us. We just need to figure out what that is.�</p><p>�����Skaata: �Some have been saying that the reason that Darigan Citadel has been unable to win the entire cup is that the roster has been stagnant for too long. Do you think that swapping a player or two would be beneficial for your performance as a team?�</p><p>�����Kep: �A change in the roster? It�s hard for me to imagine, really. I mean, sure, I suppose that�s a good way to forcefully combat stagnation, but we�ve been together as an unbroken squad since the second Altador Cup. We have a really good sense of team flow, and we�re great at reading one another and playing off each other effectively. No, I doubt we�d replace team members on a whim, especially since there�s no clear weak link in our lineup. It�s more likely that one of us would retire due to a bad injury or something equally serious � and I mean serious. We�ve stuck together through too much to just drop it all on a hunch � we Darigans take those sorts of bonds seriously. If you�ve got no loyalty, you�ve got nothing worth talking about.�</p><p>�����You know, this conversation made me think of a game from many years ago � think it was against the Haunted Woods. Now, consider this � it�s been an intense game, it�s unbelievably hot, and we�ve been juggling an unruly Darigan Yooyu that�s simply refused to leave our side of the pitch for, no exaggeration, half of the match. Haunted Woods knows that it�s just not our day, and has moved most of their defense up to try to push the aggression. It�s feeling like it�s only a matter of time until Collifey�s reflexes in the net can�t hack it � he�s looking pretty worn down by this point, too. Well, the seconds are ticking down, Collifey�s figuring out where he should aim his next throw-in� then he gets this weird look in his eye, grins like he�s just come up with the best joke of his life, and dumps the Yooyu into our own net. Layton�s furious, the crowd�s in an uproar, and I�m just thinking the heat�s gotten to his head.</p><p>�����But� as the next Yooyu is being prepared to enter the pitch, it dawns on me. The game�s been super long, Brains� stitching is starting to pop, and most of their defense is absolutely exhausted at this point, especially since most of them aren�t used to playing aggressively. What we�d really needed was a reset in position (and a more cooperative Yooyu) to be able to take advantage of that fact � and we end up taking home the W in a super close game. Layton apologised for his outburst after the fact; Collifey took it well, as he always does. Since then, Layton�s been a rock, absolutely unshakeable. All of us trust each other completely.�</p><p>�����Skaata: �I remember that game! Absolutely legendary play, and an insane amount of foresight from Collifey. You mentioned that he �always takes it well� � is it common for him to be derided for his performances?�</p><p>�����Kep: �Sort of, but perhaps not in the way you expect. As you�re probably thinking, goalkeepers really do catch a lot of flak for fumbling shots, even if those shots were pretty much uncatchable, just because that�s the clearest way for many a casual fan to process the failure to stop a goal; defenders mispredicting or offense mispositioning are more abstract than that, and require more game knowledge to detect. That�s not really what I meant, though. Collifey actually performs with Frein in a comedy club on the weekends, a sort of funny man/straight man act, if by �straight man� you mean �Frein absolutely buries Collifey in the most outlandish insults and practical comedy bits you can imagine�. It�s all part of the act, of course, but Darigan humour�s a little different than that of the, uh, �continentals�, as we say. You think my insults are good? Well, they don�t call him �the Terror� for nothing, you know; they had to add a bit into the rules to ban trash talking on the field, Frein was just so good at getting into the enemy�s head and tilting them off the face of the planet. There�s a reason Layton doesn�t want him doing interviews. It�s a great show, by the way! Huge recommend from me, especially if you feel like supporting local businesses and if you have a sense of humour underneath that squeaky-clean reporter schtick.�</p><p>�����Skaata: �Hah! You want a sense of humour? You know that King Skarl guy? Well I found my way into his chambers once, and you won�t believe ��</p><p>�����I�m afraid I�ll have to cut it off here, ladies and gentlemen, so I don�t get sued for defamation of character (of course, I never actually made it into his chambers� I promise! I swear! 100% joke setup only!) Tune in next time for a grand trip to the mountains featuring another popular team! </p><p>�����<b>The End.</b> </p>"

      "Piece": "<font size=5>C</font>hapter 6 � Lacrimoso<p>�����~X~</p><p>�����Upon entering into the dark hole in the sky, Jeran was instantly hit with the overwhelming, echoing cries of a child. The wails bounced off black walls in a large, spacious room. In the distance, a bright, shimmering light hit a single spot, illuminating it. From beyond the spotlight, there was a wooded platform. Dim light spilt upon a pully system that might lift or lower a heavy black curtain.</p><p>�����Jeran tilted his head in confusion. <i>A stage? Why would Rohane be dreaming about a stage?</i></p><p>�����It was known that the knight had a strong aversion to any sort of performing arts. When asked to sing carols in the streets, he tensed up. </p><p>������Not a chance,� Jeran recalled him saying. When asked why, he would shrug. �Not my thing.�</p><p>�����He would avoid the topic beyond to say that his former travelling companion, Velm, was an excellent bard and had a talent for the lute. At least then he would have a sad, almost nostalgic smile on his face while he�d recount their journey together. Apparently, the charismatic Techo had spent many nights entertaining them in the Haunted Woods and Faerieland, and was well-known throughout those realms as a world-class entertainer. There were even life-sized statues built in his honour across Faerieland after Terask had been defeated. �The Master Bard,� they called him, and the name adorned golden placards in highly visible places. One particularly enthusiastic innkeeper apparently insisted on framing the Techo�s signature and hanging it over the inn door for good luck. Stating this never failed to bring the Blumaroo a fading smile.</p><p>����� �I miss that dork,� Rohane would say, suddenly sullen over his plate of dining hall meatloaf. He would poke the chunk of meat with a fork for the fifth time without taking a bite. �I miss all three of them like family.�</p><p>�����Once, Jeran recalled, Rohane duelled him for a most peculiar prize. If he won, he would not be forced to sing a festival�s ceremonial song. None of the knights could wrap their heads around Rohane�s request. Danner suggested it was Rohane�s sensitive ears�the Blumaroo could hear a Buzzer two fields away with ease, or so the rumours. Even the highest mosquito buzz he picked up in an instant. But when asked, Rohane merely said, �no particular reason. Just don�t want to.�</p><p>�����Needless to say, the festival sing-along� didn�t sound great. No one in the Order was a musician. A few of the nobles were forced to learn an instrument growing up as part of their �higher standard,� but most of the crew could barely carry a tune. It was just one of those things they were expected to do to show �community spirit.� That and it was a good excuse for King Skarl to throw a large, lavish banquet. And the King loved any opportunity to host a large meal. </p><p>�����Rohane won the duel. It had been a close match, but Jeran had been caught off-guard by the Blumaroo�s sterling resolve. Jeran still hated how soundly the Blumaroo had disarmed him�in front of a crowd, no less. And all over something as tame as music. As the Blumaroo walked away, he looked <i>relieved</i>. Not smug or arrogant, but relieved as if a weight had been lifted off of his chest. Jeran could never quite understand it.</p><p>�����Covering one hand over his ears�as the crying was starting to give him a splitting headache�he crept forward with caution. His hand rest on the sword�s hilt, ready to draw. After what happened with Scuzzy, he was not about to take any chances. </p><p>�����Dim light began to illuminate the room�s features, and the distant shapes of the audience took form. </p><p>�����They were all monsters. </p><p>�����None of them moved from their seats. Their glassy-eyed stares looked into the distance, focusing on nothing and no one. A chill rose from Jeran�s spine. If he had to fight even a fraction of these creatures solo, it would be overwhelming. There were <i>hundreds</i> of them. All the more reason to not draw attention to himself.</p><p>�����Then again, there was a child sobbing, and none of these creatures seemed to have noticed. </p><p>�����Backstage seemed to drag on for miles. Fragments of different worlds, like a piece of Meridellian farmstead or a chunk of desert, peppered the otherwise dark wall. Upon approaching the spotlight, Jeran noticed a shaking, huddling form. They had ceased their squalling, perhaps from wearing themselves to the point of exhaustion. As bad as it made him feel to think it, he was thankful for the moment of quiet. </p><p>�����He studied the creature with caution. A blanket wrapped around their body like a tunic; even then, they still quaked like a leaf in the wind. Perhaps they were cold? But no, that wasn�t it. The room felt pleasant, almost comfortable, compared to the frigid conditions in Terror Mountain. The fact that Jeran could not see their eyes made him uneasy. Who knew what or who from their childhood could be beneath the shadows? Jeran turned his head this way and that to get a better look, but they held their head between their knees. Long ears came up in stalks from the figure and flopped down towards the middle. And from behind their blanket tunic, there was a long, thick tail that lay flat across the ground.</p><p>�����A Blumaroo. They were a Blumaroo.</p><p>�����But there was no way that could be Rohane. Sure, the muscular, stockily built Blumaroo wasn�t very tall, in fact he barely came up to Jeran�s chin, but this was someone far smaller�far younger than Rohane could be in his early 30�s. Well, that and the fact that their wails sounded high and juvenile, not at all like Rohane�s mid-Baritone. </p><p>�����Before Jeran could say anything, the Blumaroo�s ears shot up like exclamation points. They whipped their tear-stained face towards Jeran and froze in fear. </p><p>������Hello,� Jeran said uncertainly, holding his weaponless hands in front of his body. �Don�t be afraid. I�m a friend.�</p><p>�����At first, they slid back, easily gliding on the smooth, wooden floor, but then they stopped when Jeran said something. They turned their head quizzically as if trying to place his features.</p><p>�����Seeing that the child had paused, Jeran continued. �Who are you? Why are you here?�</p><p>�����They turned their mouth into a deep-seated frown. No longer were they moving, but studying him as if Jeran�s very presence was somehow out of place. Something unnatural in this inexplicable world of nightmares. </p><p>������Can you�� the Lupe hesitated, �understand me?�</p><p>�����The Blumaroo pondered these words before finally responding in a high, boyish voice. �Jer� an?� The Lupe�s name was said so slowly that it sounded like someone sounding out a foreign word, but then he said it a second time, more confidently. �Jeran?� he hesitated, �is that you?�</p><p>�����The Lupe gasped at the sound of his name coming from the child�s lips. �Yes,� he placed a hand on his heart, �my name is Jeran. Do you know who I am? Where Rohane is?�</p><p>������Jeran� I know you.� He paused again, letting the question soak in. He had since unwrapped his arms from his legs, showing his short-white fur and pink-padded feet. He was wearing a simple green tunic and a wooden short sword was laying across his lap. �You�re my father�s squire. Do you know where he is?� He began to sniffle again. �I really, really miss him and� and I don�t know why. It�s making me really sad.� </p><p>�����Jeran�s mouth flung open as his eyes widened to this size of saucers. Sir Reynold, the knight he had squired for, had two sons, the first of whom he already met in dream Trestin. The second of whom was�</p><p>������Rohane.� The Blumaroo child said it quietly, tears lining their exhausted eyes. �That�s my name.�</p><p>�����~X~</p><p>�����For a moment, nobody moved. Everyone stood as if frozen in place. </p><p>�����It was Danner who acted first while Kayla remained slack-jawed in shocked silence. His eyes scanned the Darigan Eyrie for any obvious injuries. When nothing seemed serious, he bent down and lightly shook him.</p><p>������Hey. Hey, you okay?� When the Eyrie didn�t respond, he placed his ear to his chest and felt the air slowly rise and fall from his lungs. �Out cold. But otherwise, he�s alright. Breathing, at least.� </p><p>�����Kayla�s fingers grew weak as the handle slipped from her grasp, spilling ingredients to the floor. Luckily, none of them splattered from the force of the fall, but a few were bruised and one glass vial cracked. The sound of clattering goodies shocked Kayla back into reality.</p><p>������Oh no, oh no,� she whispered, before corralling the various fruits, spices, and flasks of liquids back in the basket. She dared not look at Lisha, who had yet to make another sound since they opened the door. Her long ear stalks nearly touched the ground as she held her head low.</p><p>������Help me prop him up, Kayla,� started Danner, who eyed Lisha wearily while they pushed him into a sitting position. �We�ll have to lift him up later; he�s surprisingly heavy. I guess they make them muscular in the Citadel.� He let out a chuckled wheeze as he pushed him forward. With Kayla grabbing his ruff, they pulled him against a shelving unit. The Darigan stirred slightly, grunting as he was tugged back, but visibly relaxed against the wall. Kayla grabbed a few pillows from the couch where Rohane slept and placed them all around the passed-out Darigan. </p><p>�����In the background, they heard a low yell. It was coming from Jeran.</p><p>�����Lisha�s ear stalks shot up as her lower ears twitched. Wordlessly, she spun around and crawled alongside her brother. She squeezed his hand as he drew his breath quickly, clearly panicked. His entire body strained as is pushing against some incredible weight before melting back into the seats. From where the Aisha knelt, she could see tears lining his eyes. Before the others could see, she gently brushed his face and eyes with a quaking hand. Preoccupied in her fretting, she hardly noticed a burly shadow looming above her. </p><p>�����Danner threw another blanket atop the shaking Lupe. It drifted gently along his body, adding yet another layer to his pile. �Hope this helps. I wasn�t sure what else I could do,� said the Wocky, clearly frustrated. �Lisha, we need to talk. Kayla told me everything.�</p><p>�����Lisha scrunched up the fabric of her knee-length skirt. Despite everything, the spell had not broken. Weakened, flickered, but not broken. A light green glow still emanated from her face and eyes, making Lisha appear almost ethereal. But between the gauntness of her frame and the ashen hue of her complexion, the Aisha looked sickly and frail. Still, she held on. </p><p>������Okay,� she intoned in a voice both tired and sad. </p><p>�����The Wocky offered a hand, which she quietly declined.</p><p>������What happened?� he asked carefully. With a gentle hand, he moved the assortment pillows to better support Jeran�s arms and legs. �This will help with some of his stiffness at least�� he said airily before he returned to Kayla�s side and guided her to a chair. She sat shakily, the basket quaking in her grasp.</p><p>������I� I thought I could do everything. And when Serian thought I had gone too far�� immediately upon saying this, Donner�s face darkened. His hand slid towards his sword. �He tried to get help. To warn Kayla.� The vice-captain cast a glance at the Eyrie and made a bright-sounding �huh,� as if pleasantly surprised. </p><p>������It�s my fault.� Kayla bit at her finger while Danner grimaced awkwardly. �I should never have given you such a strong hpo��</p><p>������No, Kayla. It�s mine.�</p><p>������You were just��</p><p>������Trying to pull a heroic stunt� and turning it into a very <i>not</i> heroic stunt.� She laid her head against the couch and felt the rising of Jeran�s chest. He had since calmed down, but his features still appeared distressed. �I really messed up.�</p><p>�����Kayla let out a low whine. �Don�t say that, Lisha. I shouldn�t have placed all this burden on you. I made a dangerous potion� and you paid the price.�</p><p>������No.� She shook her head. �No, that�s not it at all. Kayla, it was the best option we had. I let it control me, let it cloud my judgement.� Lisha turned to meet Kayla�s sorrowful gaze with tears in her eyes. �Serian was right, power really <i>is</i> dangerous.� Her voice grew soft. �I�m so sorry, bro. Some little sister I am.� She kneaded the couch�s fabric in her hand before gripping it tightly. �What can I do to make up for this?�</p><p>������And how can I help?� interrupted Danner, who had begun pacing the room. �Because all this standing around is making me anxious.�</p><p>����� �We�re going to brew an energy share potion�� Kayla dug her hands into the basket and began stacking ingredients by type. �Serian had the right idea. We�ll burden this spell� together.�</p><p>�����~X~</p><p>�����Even in the low light, Jeran couldn�t help but notice the chilling resemblance to the under-foot child who would beg for sword lessons the times when Jeran would come by to visit Sir Reynold�s family. A thousand questions swam through Jeran�s head, like if he was just another manifestation of the Blumaroo�s nightmares, or how he was in this state, or why he was crying, or how he knew who he was if he was or�</p><p>������<i>You�re</i> Rohane!?� As soon as he said it, he dragged his hand across his face. <i>Real smooth, Jeran</i>, he berated himself. <i>He�s going to think you�re crazy.</i></p><p>�����A few moments passed where the child stared at him like he had two heads. </p><p>������Yes?� Rohane replied with a tilt of his head, before stumbling up to his feet. He busied his thumbs as he approached the Lupe who stood almost twice his height. Rather than look Jeran in the eyes, Rohane chose to stare at the Lupe�s fluffy tail. Jeran took a step back instinctively, causing the child to pout. </p><p>�����It was difficult to take, seeing what could very well be his comrade-in-arms as a child of perhaps 8, standing a few feet away. When Rohane reached his arm out to tug Jeran�s tunic, Jeran was left speechless. Rohane would do this all the time when they were children, to the point where it got annoying.</p><p>����� Perhaps this really <i>was</i> him�the mannerisms were all the same. But no, <i>no</i>, how could this even happen? It was a dream and all, but then wouldn�t he be more�</p><p>������Hey, Jeran?� asked Rohane, only now giving the Lupe eye contact. �Can I ask you something?�</p><p>������Can I ask you something?� was often the way they�d start their conversations as youth, when Rohane was a painfully shy, introverted child, but would open up with a question. Or an offer to spar, as the child often daydreamed of being a knight just like his father. </p><p>������Y-yeah?� </p><p>�����It was still weird. He said it just then, like a trip down his ingrained memories.</p><p>������Are you�� Rohane kicked at the ground beneath his feet, causing the polished wood to squeak. �Are you afraid of anything?�</p><p>�����The Lupe glowered at the question; his suspicions immediately arose. What if this was part of a ruse? Part of something the dream would use to further torture him? He hardened his voice and crossed his arms.</p><p>������No,� he answered it simply. �Nothing scares me.�</p><p>������Nothing? Wow. You really are strong like father. Nothing scares him, either.�</p><p>�����Rohane looked up at him in awe, sparkles in his eyes. Jeran couldn�t help but feel very uncomfortable at this development. It wasn�t like stoic Blumaroo to <i>idolize</i> him for anything. Rather, the two of them would often butt heads over who was making the right judgement call. Given that Rohane was the captain of his merry band of adventurers, he wasn�t used to taking anyone else�s orders. Even when Rohane had good feedback, it still grated on Jeran�s nerves. He found himself purposely disagreeing for the sake of being petty, much to Danner�s and Rohane�s displeasure. </p><p>�����Jeran opened his mouth to disagree with the Blumaroo�s statement, but thought better of it. As hard as it would be to explain to a child, Sir Reynold was not always fearless. He was a Neopian with all of the emotions, doubts, and insecurities that came with being alive. Part of the burden of being a knight�s squire was to listen when they were down. To provide counsel and guidance when they asked. To hear about their life�s ups and downs. Their victories, their regrets� and their fears. One of Sir Reynold�s biggest fears was that he wasn�t a good father. He would say that to Jeran when they would spend weeks at a time in Meridell. How guilty he felt for not visiting more, for not doing more for them. How terrible he felt the day he was unable to visit for his eldest son�s 13th birthday or his wedding anniversary. All of these came up in frequent conversation and it weighed heavily on Jeran�s heart.</p><p>�����When Sir Reynold would treat Jeran to a meal after a long day�s work, he would often find his liege looking forlorn and distant. If Jeran brought it up, he�d give Jeran a playful clap on the back, cover his sadness with the mask of a broad grin and say, �don�t worry about it, kiddo. I�m doing just fine.� Meanwhile, his dinner plate would be left half-touched and four large tankards of soda would be stacked precariously at the edge of the table as he called for another. </p><p>����� Sometimes Sir Reynold would give spirited performances at the local taverns. The second they�d walk through the door, three cheers of �huzzah� would ring out throughout the room. The middle-aged knight was well known throughout the realm for his battle prowess, but also for his smooth baritone voice. The soldiers spoke fondly of his talents during the early days of the Meridell Wars. They said his voice could teleport them from their tightly packed, poorly resourced and war-wary camps to someplace merry and peaceful. And Jeran knew all too well how important those little pieces of home could be when you were huddling in close quarters hours before sunrise, too anxious to sleep.</p><p>�����It always seemed a shame that neither of his sons had an interest or gift for music, that�s what his tavern friends had often said. Rohane still received a barrage of requests when he�d be recognized as Sir Reynold�s son�especially at local eateries�but much to their disappointment, he wouldn�t sing a note. </p><p>������You don�t want to hear me sing,� he�d say with a nervous chuckle, before ordering a plate of fried marrow strips and stuffing his face. </p><p>�����<i>He really enjoys those things</i>, Jeran thought with a chuckle, <i>it�s practically all he orders</i>, before recalling that the hazy specter from the smoke-filled Haunted Woods tent echoed the same. The image of them made a chill rise through his spine. Had they been a manifestation of Rohane�s darker thoughts? He had never figured it out while they were coloured the exact opposite of the white-furred Blumaroo. </p><p>�����Jeran sighed lightly. But this may or may not be Rohane. This was, after all, a dream, and they had a fair share of overlapping childhood memories. But chances were this crying child could help him find a way out of this room, and that was priority. </p><p>����� �How am I not afraid? I�m just brave, is all.� Jeran said it with a non-committal shrug. �How about you, Ro�� Jeran paused as their eyes locked. The child listened with rapt attention, bending closer to latch on to every word. ��hane.� His throat felt dry after saying his colleague�s name. �Are you afraid of anything?�</p><p>�����Rohane�s face fell as his long, springy ears lowered. �Yeah�� tears lined his eyes as he said it. �I�m afraid of singing.� As soon as he said it, he started to cry. �It�s dumb, I don�t know why I get so scared. My big brother said I sound like a wet Meowclops, maybe he�s right. Maybe dad was wrong when he said I was good. Maybe I� maybe I��</p><p>�����Jeran�s blood went cold. It was just like the nightmare versions of his companions said, when they pointed at a pillory of the stoic Blumaroo in vicious mockery. But could someone as strong as Rohane really be terrified of <i>singing?</i> It just didn�t make sense. </p><p>������Like a wet Meowclops?� </p><p>������Yes.�</p><p>�����The child began to bawl and buried his face into Jeran�s bushy tail, hugging it like an oversized stuffed toy. Snot ran from his nose and covered Jeran�s fur as he burrowed in, causing him to involuntarily gag. When he tried to pull his tail away, the child only held it tighter, and tugged it so hard the knight nearly toppled. Jeran grunted in pain from the vice grip. </p><p>������For what it�s worth,� Jeran muttered under his breath, �I�m really starting to hope you <i>aren�t</i> him. Because I swear to Skarl, if you are� if you are�� he let out an exasperated sigh as he tried once more to free himself, �I doubt either of us will be able to live this down.� </p><p>������I�m sorry I�m so scared�� whimpered the child as he began to shake. �I�m sorry� I�m really sorry��</p><p>�����It would�ve been easy enough just to comfort him, to use placating niceties in the hopes of quelling him, but instead he chose to drop to one knee. Now on eye level with one another, Rohane grew increasingly shy and looked everywhere but Jeran�s face.</p><p>������Can I tell you something, Rohane?� he started, �after you let go of my tail?� Rohane did as such, and found a seat on Jeran�s raised knee. Instead of chiding him, Jeran lowered his shoulders in resignment and continued. �When I told you that I wasn�t scared of anything� that was a lie.�</p><p>�����A gasp arose from a foot from Jeran ears as he let off a huff, then jumped off the Lupe�s knee. �You <i>lied</i>?� a look of hurt flashed across Rohane�s face. �Squires shouldn�t lie.�</p><p>�����Jeran took a long look at the child before his voice softened. �You�re right. I�m sorry about that.� He lowered himself to a seated position and tapped the ground to invite Rohane over. It was hard to ignore the twinge in his stiff legs as they popped angrily in protest. Even in a dream, there was no way to avoid the aftermath of the Second War.</p><p>�����The child turned away; a mischievous grin was written on his face. �I dunno. Do I want to sit next to a <i>liar squire</i>?� His childish voice jumped an octave on the last two words. </p><p>������Really, Rohane?� Jeran rolled his eyes. �Liar squire? Is that the best you got?�</p><p>������Uh huh. That�s what you are� liar squire.� He tried not to laugh, but strained giggles escaped from his mouth through cupped hands. �Jeran the liar squire.�</p><p>������Oh <i>yeah</i>? Then you�� Jeran rested his hand on his fist and smirked, �are a meathead.�</p><p>�����Again, there was something oddly empowering about using the term towards someone other than himself�even if a few Neopians had the gall to call the two of them the �Meatheads of Meridell.�</p><p>������Nuh-uh.� Jumping back, Rohane landed on his springy tail and jumped 10 feet into the air; Jeran whistled in genuine amazement as he continued a jumping volley for well over a minute. �Could a� meathead� do� <i>this</i>?� He did a flip. �Or <i>this?</i>� He spun in a circle mid-air. </p><p>�����Chuckling under his breath, Jeran responded with a polite clap. The child wiggled with excitement, eager to impress.</p><p>����� �No. No, a meathead could not.� He stood up and gave a wave towards the stage. He was wasting enough time as it was. �Now, come on, kiddo�� </p><p>�����Jeran bit back the word as soon as he said it. Sir Reynold spoke the very same way to him when he was young�heck, even after he was knighted, Sir Reynold referred to him more so as �kiddo� than his actual name, despite being 18 years old. The thought made him feel sad, reminiscent of the days that they spent training together before he was� before he had�</p><p>������Are you crying� liar squire?� Rohane said it with concern as he slowed his bouncing to a little hop. He came within mere inches of Jeran�s face with a few of his hops.</p><p>������A little,� Jeran admitted while bending away from this breach of his personal bubble, �but I�m� I�m okay. They�re happy tears.� He rubbed his eyes tiredly, feeling the weight of the bags under them. Before Rohane could question him, he pushed the point. �But here: let me tell you what I�m afraid of.�</p><p>�����Rohane immediately slid to the ground and settled in right next to him, babbling excitedly. �Is it Spyders? I bet it�s Spyders�Reuben hates those. Raining Mortogs? Flying Snorkle? <i>Evil tomatoes</i>? How about��</p><p>������It�s failing the knights who depend on me.�</p><p>������Oh.� Rohane quieted down and stared at his feet, which had since crisscrossed over one another like a pretzel. �The knights who depend on you, huh?�</p><p>������Yeah,� he said it airily. �When you�re a leader, you have the weight of every Neopian in your charge on your shoulders. Their dreams, their hopes�� as he spoke, his snot-covered tail wrapped under his legs, �their very lives.� He paused when he realized the child�s action had left a trail of goo along the floor. He frowned deeply, increasingly annoyed at how realistically disgusting this all was. �So, when you make a mistake, when <i>your</i> actions cause someone else to get hurt, it�s hard�really hard�to feel like you can lead again. There are�� his heart sank lower as he said it, �a few Neopians who are no longer around because of the decisions I made.� His voice shuddered. �And I live with that reality every day.�</p><p>������I�m sorry,� Rohane replied before shimmying over a few feet and resting his head against the knight�s waist. The Blumaroo closed his eyes. He took a deep breath. �It�s not easy to lose a friend.�</p><p>�����Jeran tensed up immediately, his heart fluttering with panic. They were comrades-in-arms, after all, with Jeran being his superior officer. To have him in <i>this close</i> felt wrong, especially with how private of a Neopian Rohane usually was. They were colleagues, not brothers, not travelling companions like with Velm, Mipsy, and Talinia. It was almost striking how much more open Rohane seemed this young�well, if a dream could be a barometer for his actual personality. Had his father�s early death been the catalyst to shut off his emotions so completely? His friends had admitted that he was often calm to the point of being icy and distant�that is, unless it was just them together�and even then, he didn�t really thaw until they had known each other well. </p><p>������I-it�s alright.� The Lupe scooched back and rose to his feet in a rush, causing the Blumaroo�s head to dip before he let out a little �awwww.� �It�s all how we move on from it that matters. We live, we learn, we do better.� He took a long look at Reynold�s sword as his heart sank. �That�s just life.�</p><p>������Well�� the Blumaroo peddled his feet, his voice quiet and thoughtful. �I think you�re learning. You�re doing a good job.�</p><p>������Thanks, ki�Rohane,� he corrected himself, clicking his tongue between the words, �I just want to live up to the example I was taught, is all.�</p><p>������I understand.� Springing to his feet, Rohane opened his mouth to speak. A flash of realization passed over his face. �It�s just like what my dad when he heard me sing� I was scared that he was wrong when he said he liked it my voice. Maybe you�re scared because you want to make my dad proud� just like me.� </p><p>�����Jeran winced at the thought. �You�re probably right.� Before Rohane could see, he brushed a paw over his eyes. <i>I wonder what he�d think seeing them together like this</i>. The thought crossed Jeran�s mind. Not in the dream world, but as Captain of the Order and �Hero of Five Lands.� It was a rare day when either of them could go anywhere without being recognized for their acts of bravery and heroism. Surely, his mentor would have been happy to see them both succeeding and living honest lives. After imagining Sir Reynold�s stern but approving face, he smiled sadly. There was nothing he wanted more than for the ageing yellow Blumaroo to tussle his fur and say, �you did good, kiddo.� �I�m sure he�d be proud of us both, Ro��</p><p>�����Before the Lupe could stop him, Rohane threw both arms around Jeran�s torso and hugged him tightly. Jeran let out a wheezed gasp. For someone so small, Rohane had quite the vice grip. �I�m so glad. I�m so glad I�m not alone.� </p><p>�����A crimson blush covered Jeran�s face and rose to the tips of his ears. So lost was he for words that he stammered an assortment of sounds, none of which made for a compelling sentence. He attempted to lay a hand around the child�s shoulder to give a supportive pat, like his mentor might�ve, but was stopped by a wall of magic.</p><p>�����A swirl of golden light surrounded Rohane, blinding the Lupe momentarily. Between the glistening specks, the first thing he could make out were two long ears standing straight up in front of his face like exclamation points. And far larger arms wrapped around his waist. Within a few seconds, the Blumaroo�s ears were bright red. Before Jeran could react, a forceful shove knocked him over while Rohane was flung in the opposite direction. Both Neopians exclaimed a garbled cacophony of sounds as they skid along the ground. Jeran especially felt a loud pop from his left shoulder as it hit the hard floor. He bit through the pain as he squeaked to a rough stop.</p><p>�����Rohane, now his normal, adult size, covered a hand across his face and squeezed his eyes shut. He looked as if ready to bounce away into the darkened abyss. The embarrassment was so palpable that it felt like an aura, radiating in every direction. </p><p>�����Neither Neopian looked at each other, but instead at the floor, the wall, the dark, star-covered ceiling, and the distant, foreboding spotlight on the stage. Rohane took a long gaze at the spotlight before returning to his pit of self-wallowing.</p><p>�����In a voice uncharacteristically emotional for the normally stoic Blumaroo, he said, between burrowing his face in his hands and curling into a ball, �I can�t believe that just happened. I�m mortified�<i>mortified</i>. I�ve never been more embarrassed in my life. Reuben would never let me live this down.� He then flopped on the ground like a fish at the market. �This is the end. I have ceased to be.�</p><p>�����Jeran raised a hand to say something, but no words came. Only a prolonged low grumble and a face so crimson that it would give a tomato a run for their money. </p><p>�����Rohane, who was dressed in simple green tunic and brown trousers, sighed dejectedly from his flattened state. �Any chance you're just another one of the specters from this never-ending nightmare?� </p><p>�����A few seconds of silence passed, and with two words, Rohane�s flicker of hope extinguished. �Afraid not.� Before Rohane could ask, he added, �Lisha found a spell to send me into your dream, so like or it not, it�s the real me.�</p><p>�����Rohane face planted, squishing his nose against the wooden floor. �Fantastic,� he said in a nasal voice. �Just leave me here to expire, then.� </p><p>������No can do,� said Jeran, who had thoughts of dragging his subordinate by the arms or legs, if need be. He briefly pondered all the ways that he could force him to join but quickly thought better of it. He needed Rohane�s willing participation if escape was going to be possible. �We�re leaving together.� </p><p>������Oh yeah?� Rohane rested his chin on the ground, his long snout laying out in front. �And how do propose we do that?� there was a bite of sarcasm in his voice as he waved his arms up and down in mockery, �fly out?�</p><p>������No idea�probably not flying, though.� His eyes narrowed as he bit back his anger. �I really thought you�d know something�this <i>is</i> your nightmare, after all.�</p><p>������I don�t.�</p><p>�����Jeran crossed his arms. �Great lot of help you are.�</p><p>������I mean,� Rohane�s voice was even, �having my adult memories locked away in the dark recesses of my mind while I sobbed for my dead father probably didn�t help.�</p><p>�����Jeran sucked in his breath, then immediately berated himself for losing his temper. �Right. I� I�m sorry, Rohane. This hasn�t been a fun ordeal for you, has it?�</p><p>������You try playing your worst fears, weaknesses, and shortcomings on loop and see what it does to your mental state.� Using his fist, he forced himself to his knees. �It�s exhausting.�</p><p>������Believe me,� Jeran tried to chuckle, but it came out forced and unnatural, �I understand.� He grunted loudly as he knelt on one knee. A loud pop sprung from the muscles, causing him to wince. Evidently, the dream stage wasn�t a soft landing.</p><p>�����Rohane echoed the Lupe�s actions, closing one eye as he saw his companion struggle. �You�re hurt,� he said as he rose shakily to his feet, �let me help you up.� A wash of dizziness fell over him as he stumbled forward�dehydration, he realized glumly. After steadying his steps, he held out both arms and waited until the world stopped spinning. </p><p>�����With finesse, Jeran dug into the pack on his back, one that had somehow managed freezing cold, blasting sand, and magical energy. A swift swipe of his hand and he uncorked an aquamarine potion and chugged the contents whole. After a contented burp, he replied, �I�m just peachy. And yourself?�</p><p>������I�m fi��</p><p>������No, you�re not. Take the potion, Rohane.� Jeran tossed a vial underhand in what would normally be an easy catch. The Blumaroo blinked at the object as it hurtled towards his face and caught it awkwardly, hand-over-hand, centimetres from his snout. In the process of catching the potion, it had nearly bounced out of his hand and onto the floor.</p><p>������Could have warned me,� growled Rohane, tightening his grip on the flask. When the Lupe merely shrugged, Rohane uncorked the bottle and took careful gulps of the potion, rolling his eyes as he did. �And you�re still favouring your left leg.�</p><p>������Less worrying about me, more figuring out how to get out of here.� After wiping the potion juice from his moustache, the Lupe gave a dismissive wave, but retracted it when his knee throbbed again. He reached down towards the knee and massaged it, hoping that might calm down the spasms. He forced a smile through an otherwise scrunched face, making him look like he had walked into the castle sewers and smelled a dung monster.</p><p>������You�re not okay.�</p><p>������Yes, I am.�</p><p>�����The Blumaroo gave an annoyed huff. �Fine.� <i>Meathead</i>, he added mentally. �But isn�t this my dream? What kind of nightmares would you have here: being called a meathead? Losing handily in a duel against yours truly?� He bounced his brows once as he said it the last line. �Because that sounds like a pretty great dream to me.�</p><p>�����Jeran scoffed. �You�re the meathead. And that win was a fluke.�</p><p>������No, I�m not.� His short fur bristled. �And I remember it differently.�</p><p>������You would.� Jeran�s sword hand twitched. �We�ll have to settle this when we�re both out of here.�</p><p>������Fine by me. I don�t mind winning again.�</p><p>������In your dreams.� Jeran�s overconfident demeanour melted when took a deep breath and massaged his head; deep creases formed across his forehead. �But no. It wasn�t that, Rohane. It was something far, far worse.�</p><p>�����Noticing the change in his demeanour, the Blumaroo took a step forward, concern written on his face. �Was it my fa��</p><p>������It was Lord Kass.�</p><p>������Oh.� Rohane stopped in his tracks. His ears drooped as he scratched awkwardly at his chin. �I heard about him from the others; he seemed like a�� he swallowed hard and took a sharp breath, �like a Terask-level threat, to be sure.�</p><p>������At least�probably more.�</p><p>������Probably more?� Rohane shook his head tiredly. �There�s not much worse than him, Jeran.�</p><p>����� Terask, also known as the Tyrant King, had dethroned Queen Fyora and trapped her in stasis. Meanwhile, he unleashed all manner of chaos upon Faerieland with corrupted faeries, android Cybunnies, and a legion of other nasties. The Draik�s malice and near-takeover of the Faerie kingdom landed him on the world�s most wanted criminals list. Rohane and his crew managed to neutralize him, but not without suffering some serious, near-death injuries on their end�the swordsman worst of all. Being a melee hitter put him in striking range for most of the battle when he wasn�t finding cover or being healed by Velm. That, at least, was what Jeran was able to glean from the bard�s concerned musings. </p><p>������But there are some wounds even magic can�t heal,� the ornately robed Techo said pensively as he set his helmet aside atop the mess hall table. He then reached for the lute that he always travelled with, as if on a reflex. Giving it a good strum, he continued, his eyes fixed on the intricate network of strings on the instrument�s body. �Some wounds go far deeper than anything I can mend.�</p><p>�����Since then, Talinia travelled back to Terror Mountain and Velm and Mipsy to Mystery Island; none of them had yet to return. Perhaps for the best; all three heroes would have absolutely lost their gourds over the situation at hand.</p><p>�����But at least, despite everything, Rohane was safe. All they had to do now was escape.</p><p>�����~X~</p><p>�����<i>It was a warm spring morning filled with the soothing sounds of birdsong. Both of the knights were readying their practice swords for a sparring match. Just after Rohane was knighted, their matches would draw large crowds eager for free, high-quality entertainment. One particularly brazen shopkeeper sold snacks in the stands, earning him the nickname �Spar Man.� His boisterous voice resonated in the courtyard like a gong. �Get your peanuts here, hot and fresh!� �Marrow strips for sale! Endorsed by </i>the<i> Chet Flash!� �Fried potatoes! Delicious, Brightvalian-style fried potatoes for sale!� </i></p><p><i>�����But once it became obvious that the so-called �Meatheads of Meridell� would be making this a near-daily ritual, the demand fell to only the most die-hard fans and bored members of the court. Even the food vendor stopped his raucous clamouring.</i></p><p><i>�����That day, thankfully, nary a soul gathered to watch their blades dance. Perhaps it was for the best. Rohane looked </i>awful<i> with deep bags under his eggs, a half-shaven face, and a stumble in his step. </i></p><p><i>������I�m fine,� he asserted, but it was plain to see: he was not fine. Despite that, Jeran knew better than to talk the Blumaroo out of sparring. Once his mind was set on something, Rohane mulishly insisted on following through, even to the point of personal detriment. </i></p><p><i>�����At first, Jeran blocked and parried all of the Blumaroo�s strikes with ease, barely breaking a sweat. This caused the Blumaroo much frustration. He responded with wide arcs, swinging with enough power that the Lupe slid back with each successful block.</i></p><p><i>������You�re� taking it� easy� on me.� Panting, Rohane took a few uneven steps forward. His speech slurred from exhaustion as he fought to keep his head from sagging. �Hit me� hit me with all you got. I can� I can take it.�</i></p><p><i>������Are you sure?� The Lupe hesitated, and briefly debated if it would be better to call in a doctor. The way he was fighting, it seemed as if he was sick with the neoflu. �Because I really don�t want to hurt��</i></p><p><i>������Positive.� He nearly fell over and used the practice sword to catch his balance. �Very positive. Unless you think you can�t win.� </i></p><p><i>�����Any thoughts of clemency dried up as Jeran spun the sword in his hand. �Fine, but don�t say I didn�t try.�</i></p><p><i>�����Jeran came in strong with a volley of swings. Narrowly avoiding each, Rohane made progressively sloppier ripostes. Once, the wooden blade missed Rohane�s face by millimetres; he had barely bent away in time. Compared to his usual reflexes, it was like night and day. In an average sparring match, the two would spend minutes on end blocking and responding, with neither giving the other an inch. This time� something was wrong.</i></p><p><i>�����When Jeran went for an overhead swing, the Blumaroo froze. Before Jeran could pull away, the wooden sword made a clean hit on the Blumaroo�s head; today, he had stubbornly insisted against wearing any sort of helmet. Instantly, he crumbled to the ground. Instead of retaliating or thinking on his feet as he was oft to do, he held his hands defensively in front of his body as if bracing for a magical blast. </i></p><p><i>�����Jeran tossed his practice blade into the grass. </i></p><p><i>������Skarl�s shorts�you okay!?�</i></p><p><i>�����When Rohane didn�t reply, Jeran knelt beside the Blumaroo. A large welt rose from the knight�s head as he winced in throbbing pain. </i></p><p><i>�����When they did open, Rohane�s eyes stared beyond Jeran, wide with fear. His hands shook.</i></p><p><i>������Rohane�� Jeran�s voice dropped to a concerned whisper as he reached down to tap the Blumaroo�s shoulder, �what�s�� </i></p><p><i>������Gah!� Rohane pushed forward, square in Jeran�s chest, before scrambling back. </i></p><p><i>�����Jeran coughed loudly from the impact. He caught himself with his left fist, teetering on his knelt leg.</i></p><p><i>������I�m� I�m sorry,� Rohane finally said, slapping his cheek a few times before continuing. His heart was pounding so loudly that it thrummed in his ears like a bass drum. �I�m sorry you had to see that.� </i></p><p><i>�����Jeran glanced back at his practice sword, then back at his subordinate in bafflement. �What in </i>Skarl�s<i> name was </i>that<i>?� Jeran managed, a clear mixture of annoyance and worry in his voice. �And why did you push me?�</i></p><p><i>������Sorry about that.� The Blumaroo�s head hung. �I saw Terask and I� I panicked.� </i></p><p><i>�����A stiff breeze blew past, blowing with it a tornado of cherry blossom petals. For a few moments, neither knight spoke. </i></p><p><i>������Rohane.� Jeran hesitated, focusing on his colleague�s shaking frame. �Terask� is gone. He�s been gone for a few years now.�</i></p><p><i>������I know.� The Blumaroo lowered his hands from his face and hardened his features. �Tell that to my nightmares.� He picked up his sword and placed it in the nearby storage rack roughly. �I think that�s enough training for now.�</i></p><p><i>�����What Jeran regretted most was letting his comrade walk away without telling him that he also had nightmares, had spectres of the past that refused to let him move past the Second Meridell War.</i></p><p>�����~x~</p><p>�����None of his flashbacks had been as severe at the day they spared, but they certainly reared their ugly head in other ways. The mere mention of Terask�s name seemed to spark bad memories from the Blumaroo; he tensed up as if his entire body went into fight-or-flight.</p><p>������You saw Lord Kass?� Rohane rubbed his chin thoughtfully. �That�s odd. I�ve never seen him. We were lucky in Trestin�none of his goons ever saw the need to bother us out in the middle of nowhere. Too far removed from Meridell, I guess.� Shrugging, he attempted to throw in some levity. �You <i>sure</i> you weren�t thinking about that duel?�</p><p>�����The fur on the back of Jeran�s neck stood on end. �<i>Positive</i>. It�s probably just something in the dream air, then, Rohane,� the knightly captain said, his patience thinning. �Which, speaking of� what changed? Why are you, well�<i>you</i>�again?� </p><p>������No idea.� Rohane turned his sword hand in front of his eyes as if to confirm that he was, in fact, himself. �Happy for it, though.�</p><p>������Was it something I said?�</p><p>����� �I think so.� He hummed to himself; Jeran was surprised by how melodious it was. Noticing the stare, Rohane tried to pass it off as a fluke. �It�s the first thing I remember fully from the last� however long I was in that state. Before then, I was waking up in a patchwork dream �Trestin,� fighting a slew of monsters from the Haunted Woods�including a few whose heads were made of meat.� </p><p>�����Jeran guffawed. �You fought <i>meatheads</i>?�</p><p>������Surrealist dream humour, perhaps. Who knows?� He shrugged broadly. �After that, I relived some of my near-death fights and� and then�� his eyes grew distant, �it was this constant barrage of bad emotions and darkness until I recognized you. I don�t know what happened to me other than letting the feeling of being small and scared overwhelm me�� he sighed deeply, a crease sitting heavily on his brow. �That stuff you said about being a leader, that�s probably what helped me snap back into reality.� </p><p>�����Jeran�s chest felt tight. �Dream Trestin. Then you also saw��</p><p>������Yes,� his voice strained, �I saw my father. But he��</p><p>������Was missing his face?�</p><p>������Yes. And only spoke a few words on repeat. Somehow�� as he said this, he continued to stare at his sword hand as if afraid he might turn into a child once more, �somehow, that was far worse than if he had just stayed silent� I felt things that I had thought were long buried back when we buried him.�</p><p>�����Jeran�s hand shifted to the pommel of his rusty old sword, the one that had faithfully protected him through this whole ordeal. �You ever feel like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders?�</p><p>�����Rohane�s shoulders slumped. �Always. The weight of keeping everyone safe can be crushing.�</p><p>������It really can be,� sighed Jeran.</p><p>������You�d know that well given all of your responsibilities.�</p><p>������And so would you�better than anyone else in the Order. No one else has seen first-hand how hard it is to lead your troops through life-or-death struggles.�</p><p>�����Rohane pondered this for a moment and gave a thoughtful nod. �When you have others in your charge, you�ll do anything to save them�even at the cost of your own well-being and safety.�</p><p>������And solve things with over-the-top heroics?�</p><p>������Of course.�</p><p>�����The Lupe quirked a brow. �Something tells me Velm has lectured you about this before.�</p><p>������Oh, constantly,� said Rohane dismissively, a twinge of guilt on his face, �but that doesn�t change who I am. � Or who you are. You risked your life and endured my nightmares to help me.� He dusted himself off, then extended his hand forward with a genuine smile. �Thank you, Jeran. For saving me from myself.�</p><p>�����The two gave each other a hearty handshake.</p><p>������Wow�a smile. That�s a rarity.�</p><p>�����Rohane�s mouth twitched. �I�m trying to be sincere here.�</p><p>������I know. You�re just easy to tease.� Jeran made a toothy grin, before straightening his posture and becoming serious once more. �But you�re welcome, Rohane. I�m happy you�re okay.�</p><p>������Thanks.� There was a few second pauses as Rohane shifted in place. �But I swear to Skarl�� </p><p>������Nobody can know.� They said it in unison, suddenly beet red again. </p><p>������You think I want to tell the Order that you <i>hugged</i> me with your snot face?�</p><p>������Argh!� The Blumaroo pulled his ears down in anguish. �That was�I wasn�t thinking straight! For the of love of Trestin, <i>don�t</i> tell a soul about this�and especially about <i>that</i>!�</p><p>������Oh, believe me, I won�t breathe a word. Because if someone like Kayla got wind of it��</p><p>�����Rohane visibly shuddered. �We�d be ruined. I don�t think either of us could show our faces in court again. You know how some of those nobles are, like Jetsams to raw meat.� He took a step closer, his eyes growing wild. �Promise me you won�t tell any��</p><p>������I won�t!� Jeran threw his hands into the air and let out a frustrated shout. �For Skarl�s sake, trust me, Rohane. The court would have a field day, and neither of us need that.�</p><p>������Not when half the gossip already revolves around us anyway,� Rohane quipped bitterly. �There�s something about �peasant knights� that make us prime targets.�</p><p>������They�re just jealous.� Jeran rolled his eyes. �They wish they were as strong or decorated as we were. But speaking of the court dunces, I think I�d prefer their gossip to this��Jeran swept his hand around the abounding darkness��place. Whatever it is.�</p><p>������Same. Definitely same. So,� the Blumaroo took a loud, deep sigh as if it would prepare him for what he needed to say next, �I gave it some thought, and I think I know how we�re going to escape this room� but you�re going to have to keep this a secret, too.� Under his breath, he muttered, �because I swear, this keeps happening. The world is conspiring against me.�</p><p>�����The Lupe paused to consider what Rohane said before gasping lightly. �What, that you�re a singer? I won�t tell a soul.�</p><p>�����Rohane spun around and took hold of Jeran�s shoulder. He squeezed it tightly. �How did you know? Who told you? Did one of my fri��</p><p>������<i>You</i> did, you meathead, or did you forget? Your teammates didn�t say a word�your real teammates, anyway.�</p><p>������Meathead?� His brows knit in annoyance as he fixated on the word, �I�m not a��</p><p>������You said that Sir Reynold liked your singing voice as a kid�� The knight captain took hold of Rohane�s arm and gently laid it back down. �But before then, I had a hunch after everything I�ve seen. Your nightmares aren�t exactly� subtle. It was a common thread.� When he saw the panic rising on Rohane�s face, he swiftly followed up with, �does anyone else from Meridell know?�</p><p>������Not a chance�or at least, I didn�t say anything. Just my old teammates, a few inn�s worth of Neopians in the Haunted Woods and Faerieland, and some ghosts.�</p><p>�����Jeran rose a brow. �Some� ghosts?�</p><p>������Yeah. Happened when we were telling �spooky stories���he added air quotes for emphasis�\"in the Haunted Woods. It was some lunatic named Zeams with a thing for theatrics; he goaded me into singing a lullaby. Said he and some other ghosts were circulating rumours about my voice.�</p><p>������I� wow. Only you would have a story that weird�� The Lupe shook his head in amazement, and added a low, off-key whistle for good measure. The flatness of his note made Rohane involuntarily jump. �That bad, huh?�</p><p>�����The Blumaroo grimaced before pointing to his ears. �They�re sensitive.�</p><p>������Fine, I can take a hint,� he crossed his arms and huffed. �But It�s a wonder half of Neopia doesn�t know by now. You�re world-famous�you�d think something like this would be common knowledge.�</p><p>�����The corner of Rohane�s mouth twitched. �Maybe I�m just lucky.� </p><p>������Or something.� Jeran pointed at the stage up ahead. �So, should I cover my ears and turn around, then?�</p><p>������No,� the Blumaroo steeled himself as his heart begin to race. �Listen if you want. It�s not like my voice is a secret anymore�not for you, anyway.� He started to walk towards the stage. As he approached the spotlight, his clothes changed from a common brown tunic to pure gold, resplendent armour. A bejewelled sword appeared at his waist, one Jeran vaguely recognized as �The Sword of the Apocalypse,� a gift he had received during his final adventures in Faerieland. �It�s time I face my fear and�� he swallowed hard; his throat was dry as dust, �make my dad proud.� </p><p>�����As the Blumaroo stepped into the spotlight, Jeran leaned against a wall with a proud smile on his face. �Oh, Rohane, he already is� and so am I.�</p><p>�����Compared to the coolness of backstage, the spotlight felt like a blazing sun. Hundreds of eyes stared back at Rohane with a soulless gaze, not taking a second to blink. Sweat pooled down his back and neck as his heart fluttered like a dancing butterfly. Not a second of respite, not even a second to process this nightmare. Everything seemed to beckon him to the beacon of the stage; every thought, every fibre of his being screamed in defiance. He wanted to run, to find that safe corner of his mind and cling to it rather than to face the darkness alone. </p><p>�����Well, perhaps not alone. Not anymore. </p><p>�����Now he had Jeran.</p><p>�����The Blumaroo took a long look back at the darkness where Jeran leant against a wall; he was giving a thumbs-up. It was much like what Velm did each time Rohane would sing; a nod, a wink, a thumbs-up, a smile, it was all there. Or in the actions of Mipsy who clapped off-beat while her foot tapped to her own rhythm. Or the hug Talinia gave him after he had sung a song in memory of his father at the �Plated Guardian,� a Faerieland inn run by one of his late father�s dear friends. </p><p>�����Perhaps� perhaps he could sing after all. </p><p>�����<i>To be continued�</i> </p>"

      "Piece": "<font size=5>J</font>erdana gathered the rest of the Altador Council as soon as Finneus finished explaining the reality of their predicament. If Kelland�s description of Oberon�s condition in his tomb was even slightly accurate, King Altador should have had no trouble dispatching him, and that would mean Xantan was free once again. Altador had failed to answer any of her magical messages, as had the soldiers who had gone with him, which only served to further deepen her concerns.<p>�����Torakor put the Altadorian Army on its highest alert. The city gates were closed fast, the population ordered to stay indoors for their own safety. Siyana had sent a message to Queen Fyora in Faerieland to advise her of the potential danger, though they had yet to receive a reply.</p><p>�����The ten of them gathered in the council chambers, with Finneus to advise them.</p><p>������We must assume King Altador has fallen until we hear otherwise,� Marak said. �What would Xantan�s first order of business be?�</p><p>������Neopia has changed immeasurably since his time,� Finneus told them. �Everyone he knew in life perished thousands of years ago. Neopia Central is built on the bones of Neopia City, which he founded. But he would not recognise even a single building in that twisted metropolis now. The Temple of Roo crumbled to nothing eons ago. Sunny City gave way to Shenkuu in the mountains, and Meadow Vale long twisted into the Haunted Woods. The Circle themselves saw to Kal Panning. Everything will be new to him. He will not flock to a fortress, because he has no home remaining. His goal, so the Book of the Twelve tells us, is eternal life. And I believe his first matter will be seeking out and destroying anything that could threaten his return.�</p><p>������Then Faerieland is in terrible danger,� Psellia said. �I hope our message got to her in time.�</p><p>������I don�t believe he will head to Faerieland,� Jerdana said. �When he last walked Neopia, Faerieland was in the sky and the Faeries were still in the middle of a civil war. I doubt he even met a Faerie. He is from a world where Neopets held all the power, and will think like that.�</p><p>������Then we will be his target,� Torakor said with a grim nod. �He knows of us through Altador himself, and he knows we are powerful. He will come here to flatten us before moving on to the rest of Neopia.�</p><p>������I agree,� Jerdana said. �We must be ready. I will begin enchanting the walls as best I can. We would do well to draft anyone in the city who can practice magic into the army�s ranks. Xantan is not from an age of steel. He will fight with magic, and we must answer in kind.�</p><p>�����The doors to the council chamber burst open, revealing the Faerie, Kaia, with her stricken friend Reizo in her wake.</p><p>������What is it?� she asked. �Is she free?�</p><p>������This isn�t the Darkest Faerie,� Jerdana said calmly. �We�re delaying that choice until another time.�</p><p>������But I saw it,� Kaia said with a puzzled look. �The city in flames. A figure in the sky, fear in the faces of the people, and all of you standing against it.�</p><p>������Kaia has a gift that Queen Fyora calls the Sight,� Reizo added, holding himself up on the door frame with the effort of his travel. �She can see the future.�</p><p>�����The council exchanged meaningful looks.</p><p>������I fear it was not the Darkest Faerie you saw in your vision, Kaia,� Siyana said.</p><p>�����Outside, the sky was darkening, even though it was just past noon. Clouds were gathering over the city with unnatural speed, like a darkening storm was arriving. The wind picked up, and lightning began to lash down at the towers on the city walls.</p><p>������He is here,� Kaia said in a voice that seemed half-trance.</p><p>������Then we have no time for any preparations,� Psellia fretted.</p><p>�����Jerdana led them to the balcony that overlooked the city. There, as Kaia had suggested there would be, there was a dark figure silhouetted against what remained of the quickly vanishing sunlight. Only, it was not the sludge monster they had been expecting.</p><p>�����It was the body of a Lupe, flying against the wind, his arms outstretched as he channelled the magic of the storm. King Altador.</p><p>������He is still riding Altador�s body!� Jerdana gasped. �No! No, this is all wrong!�</p><p>������What�s the matter?� Kaia asked.</p><p>������My magical enchantments that protect the city!� the Aisha told her. �They are based around our strength, our bond to each other. But the chink in that armour is that they are powerless against that same bond turned inward. One of us, against the city, and they will shatter as if they did not even exist. Xantan knows what King Altador knows! We are undone!�</p><p>�����Above them, King Altador�s body came to a rest floating in the sky. With a flick of his wrists, his magic changed form. The thick clouds that now blanketed the sky began to rumble and glow with a sickly green energy, and from them erupted green flaming boulders which the spirit of Xantan launched down on the city.</p><p>�����They impacted as Jerdana said they would, without any resistance. Several towers along the city walls were instantly destroyed. Great fires were kicked up in the Park District. One of them impacted the Hall of Heroes itself, causing much of the east walls to buckle and the resulting tremors forced them all to the floor.</p><p>������We are sure we want to do this?� Sasha shouted above the sudden roar of the flames in the city below them. �Fighting the King, it may mean the end of him.�</p><p>�����Silence enveloped them for a moment. Wordlessly, they all acknowledged the truth of it. King Altador would not want Xantan to succeed, no matter the cost.</p><p>�����Jerdana nodded at Torakor, and weaved some quick magic to amplify his voice to the soldiers positioned throughout the city.</p><p>������Archers!� he roared.</p><p>�����Hundreds of magically enchanted arrows shot up from all quarters, and they might have been enough to blot out the sun had Xantan not already taken care of it. Xantan simply waved his hand and the arrows burst into flames before they even reached him.</p><p>������Siyana, Psellia,� Torakor commanded. �My soldiers can�t do a thing while he�s got the high ground on us. Bring him down!�</p><p>�����The Air Faerie and the Light Faerie lifted off and soared into the sky, each flying towards Xantan from a different direction to catch him in a pincer. Bright yellow magic erupted from Siyana�s hands while Psellia conjured a funnel of powerful air magic. Xantan, at last, moved, flying down towards the city to avoid their blasts. There, Jerdana was ready for him. She summoned up a sphere of energy - a prison to contain him. It forced him unceremoniously to the marble tiles of the Arena District. From the rubble, the ancient creature fired a beam of crackling green energy at the Hall of Heroes, narrowly missing Jerdana and collapsing much of the council chambers. It was enough to disrupt her magic, freeing him from the prison. But by then the Altadorian Army were converging on him from all sides, and Psellia and Siyana closing in from above.</p><p>�����Torakor used the momentum of the explosion at the Hall of Heroes to fall to the ground and hit it running, and found Kelland and Marak not far behind him, with Kaia flying down too.</p><p>�����The gathered forces clashed in a hail of magic and sparks, and the fallout began to impact the city, with stray bolts of magic demolishing buildings around the battlefield.</p><p>�����Sasha looked on it all and despaired, until Finneus put a reassuring hand on her shoulder.</p><p>������Buildings can be rebuilt,� he reminded her. �What matters is the people survive.�</p><p>������We won�t survive like this,� Jerdana said as she saw Siyana take a blast of the foul green energy and spiral off to recover. �We need to attack him, all at once. There�s no greater force than all of us, working together. Your power, all of you. Lend me your power.�</p><p>�����The remaining council members all nodded. They understood what she was asking, they had done it before all those centuries ago when they needed to seal the Darkest Faerie away. Gordos, Sasha, Florin, and Fauna had little combat or magical ability themselves, but they had found that their bond allowed Jerdana to increase her abilities by several magnitudes when the city was under a dire threat.</p><p>������Togther,� Jerdana whispered.</p><p>�����She felt the power of the four of them threading into her, and seized on it, grasping at the ethereal energy and projecting it out with her own. Once again, she moved to immobilise Xantan, grabbing each of King Altador�s four limbs and holding them in place. The remaining members of the council took their cue. Siyana and Psellia focused their blasts, while Kelland, Marak and Torakor leapt forth.</p><p>�����It wasn�t enough. Jerdana felt her magic tightening, like a fish caught on a line, a moment before it happened. Xantan�s magic came roaring back at her like a feedback loop, and she was forced back with the power of a green electric shock. Down in the city, an exploding sphere of the same green energy erupted from Xantan, sending his assailants flying.</p><p>�����Xantan touched himself back down lightly on the tiles of the Arena District, spreading a thin smile across King Altador�s face.</p><p>�����Fauna helped Jerdana back to her feet. Across the city, the other defenders of Altador were recovering in the rubble they now lay in.</p><p>������It�s not enough,� Jerdana lamented. �We�re not enough to stop him.�</p><p>������Perhaps there aren�t enough of you,� a voice from the remains of the council chamber said.</p><p>�����It was the Darkest Faerie, covered in rubble. It looked like she had narrowly escaped the collapse of her own prison.</p><p>������Eleven against one, it took last time, as far as I remember,� she added. �By my count, you only have ten at the moment. I can help, Jerdana. You just have to let me.�</p><p>������Absolutely not!� Reizo protested. �She�ll turn on you, more likely to join him than help you.�</p><p>������Jerdana, you have known me long enough,� the Darkest Faerie said. �Everything I have done. Everything. Not once have I ever attempted to <i>destroy</i> Altador. Rule it, yes. But never destroy it. This is my <i>home</i>. I would never let this Xantan destroy it.�</p><p>�����Jerdana looked at her for a long moment, agonising over the decision until fresh explosions from the city below made her choice for her. She nodded.</p><p>������Don�t make me regret this,� she said.</p><p>�����She took the Darkest Faerie�s hand and carefully rang her fingers over the ring, whispering a strange language over her breath. Like a key in a lock, the action was instant and clunky. Suddenly, the ring just slipped off her finger. Behind them, Reizo gasped as he felt his life returning to him, able to stand upright again.</p><p>�����Jerdana locked eyes with the Darkest Faerie, who suddenly seemed bigger, more real.</p><p>������Let�s send him back where he came from,� the Dark Faerie snarled.</p><p>�����She braced for only a moment before launching herself off the balcony and soaring down towards the battle. Jerdana nodded at the others, and once more drew on their power to hold Xantan in place. Down below, the others once more gathered to strike with blade and magic.</p><p>�����Xantan simply laughed his mad cackle.</p><p>������We have danced this dance already!� he roared. �It will help you not!�</p><p>�����Then he felt a cold chill along his spine as a hand took his shoulder from behind and s soft voice whispered in his ear.</p><p>������You�ve yet to dance with me, my dear. Though, I know this music. Shall we change the beat?�</p><p>�����Suddenly, he felt the chaos of Altador fading away. Purple smoke was surrounding him, blocking out all vision and sound.</p><p>������I�ve always had a very particular skill,� the voice in his ear added. �I can find people�s fears, Xantan. It�s a base form of magic, some would say, but very difficult to get <i>exactly</i> right. Nightmares, they are my business. But the question is, Master Wizard, what do you fear?�</p><p>������I fear nothing!� Xantan roared, still finding himself unable to move.</p><p>������Now, that�s a lie,� the whisper said. �Everyone fears something. Now, what would you fear? Certainly not losing your friends and family, you killed them all already. Your home, you corrupted. Your body, now stolen from another. The achievements of others? No, envy and wrath are so below you. You�re surely above such base fears as spyders or the dark. Ah! Of course, but it is so obvious! You fear the one thing that is inevitable. Your failure - that all your efforts to prolong your life will be for nothing. You fear <i>your own death!</i>�</p><p>�����The purple clouds relented, and Xantan was not in Altador any longer.</p><p>�����It was a cold, deserted graveyard. The tombstones looked ill kept and seldom visited. Xantan found he could move again, and felt drawn to one in particular. There, he saw the name carved into it.</p><p>�����<i>�Xantan the Foul�</i></p><p>�����The tombstone was broken, chipped at the edges. Clearly, it had been there for a long time, and no attempt had been made to repair it.</p><p>�����Terror struck Xantan at his very core. Whatever part of his rational mind that would have told him this was a hallucination brought on by the Darkest Faerie�s magic was muffled. To him, there, in that moment, it was utterly and inescapably true.</p><p>�����He died. He failed. All his years planning his eternal life. All the centuries waiting in that dark cave for liberation. And all the years twisted around the soul of King Altador. All for nothing.</p><p>�����He let out a pained a terrified scream as the dark clouds took him again. He was back in Altador now, but the terror had such a grip on him that he could not muster any counter against the attacks of the Altador Council. The screams reached higher and higher pitches and then, in a final blast of uncontrolled magic, the spirit of Xantan released King Altador a evaporated out into the air.</p><p>�����King Altador fell to the floor, deflated but alive.</p><p>������Is it over?� Torakor asked through the smoke and the haze.</p><p>�����King Altador nodded slowly. The others from the Hall of Heroes were running down the avenue to meet them.</p><p>������He is gone,� he confirmed. �At last. The Circle of Twelve can harm Neopia no more.�</p><p>������Then we are saved!� Sasha cried with joy.</p><p>������Perhaps,� Altador said, looking over his shoulder at the Dark Faerie who was looking at her hands as if she had not seen them properly in years. �Sleeper. How do you feel?�</p><p>�����The Darkest Faerie looked up at him, and a ruthless grin spread across her face. It was one King Altador recognised. One they all recognised.</p><p>������Why, I feel better than I have in a thousand years,� the Darkest Faerie replied.</p><p>�����She moved quickly, launching a blast of purple magic at the King, but Jerdana moved in front of him and blocked it with a summoned shield of energy.</p><p>������Enough!� the Aisha shouted. �Eleven against one, you are right! Here we are again!�</p><p>������Yes!� the Darkest Faerie mocked her. �And we�ll be here again and again and again! Try as you might, you can never do what you know must be done. Because you are <i>weak</i>, and you always hope for the best in people! You will always show mercy!�</p><p>������Not today,� King Altador said, drawing his sword. �Not ever again. You�ve had all the chances you�re going to get! Together, now!�</p><p>�����The eleven councillors of Altador converged on the Darkest Faerie, magical and non-magical alike. She summoned a shield of purple energy but, together, the efforts of the eleven began to weaken it.</p><p>�����The Darkest Faerie laughed shrilly.</p><p>������You talk big, Altador, but we both know that you do not have what it takes!� she shouted.</p><p>�����King Altador looked at her, nothing but pity in his eyes. But deeper still, she could see not an ounce of doubt in his mind. He was committed. He was sure.</p><p>�����He pressed the sword deeper through the magical cocoon, and the Darkest Faerie�s eyes went wide with shock.</p><p>�����They would do it. They really would. They would <i>end</i> her. She had never before considered that possibility, and she understood at once that she had pushed things too far this time. She had betrayed their trust one too many times.</p><p>�����For the briefest of moments, she tasted that first genuine pang of regret.</p><p>�����Then she detonated her magical shield, and covered them all in brilliant purple light.</p><p>�����When it was over, all that remained was a smouldering pile of ash where she had been stood.</p><p>������Is she...?� Florin asked.</p><p>������I doubt it,� Jerdana answered gravely. �Likely fled somewhere to lick her wounds. But she knows now, she will get no mercy in Altador.�</p><p>������Enough of her,� King Altador said, turning to face the burning city. �We spend entirely too much time on her, on the fact that we were betrayed, that we are eleven who were once twelve. That was Xantan�s influence. Trying to rebuild echoes of his lost Circle and the Great Empire. Well, no more. We are eleven, and eleven we shall remain. The power is never in a number. It is the people. And together, we will rebuild this city stronger than before. Altador will endure.�</p><p>����� <b>The End.</b> </p>"

      "Piece": "<font size=5>I</font>t was the first day of the Cup and my nerves were starting to get the best of me. I had barely gotten any sleep the night before and I couldn�t stomach the thought of eating. I knew I was going to pay for it later but there was nothing I could do about it now. I rode with my teammates on our way to the Colosseum. It was early in the morning but the heat was already intense.<p>�����Then there were the crowds. The streets were packed and the excitement in the air was palpable. The colours of various teams-including our own-could be picked out in the crowd. They cheered as they saw us pass, waving banners with their faces painted and decked out in hats, wigs and jerseys. It was infectious and I couldn�t keep the grin from my face. </p><p>�����At the Colosseum, my teammates led the way towards our locker room. It was a good thing I entered last as I came to a dead stop once I entered. I think I forgot how to breathe as I took in the room. It was a vision of ice blue, white and grey, the team logo on almost every flat surface. I swallowed hard, a sudden lump in my throat as I took it all in. </p><p>�����My dream had finally come true. </p><p>������Like what you see, rookie?� Osielle asked with a grin. </p><p>�����I could only nod, my tongue frozen in shock. </p><p>�����Osielle rolled his eyes before turning back to his locker. </p><p>������Your locker�s over here, Elbin,� Minae said with a wave of her hand. </p><p>�����My locker was next to hers, ice blue in colour with a gold bench in front and my jersey on full display. It had ice blue and white vertical stripes with my surname printed across the space between my wings. My pants were ice blue and I had a white fur hood, shoulder pads and mukluks. Thick leather straps secured my shoulder pads and around my waist. I had thick black gloves and my racket was ice blue with black trim. </p><p>������Elbin, gear up!� Prytariel�s order snapped me out of my daze, though there was a look of understanding in her eyes. </p><p>�����I changed into my gear, the familiar actions helping to steady my nerves�until Prytariel started talking again. </p><p>������Alright, team!� Prytariel announced, hands on her hips as she faced us, her usual smile gone from her face. �We�re kicking off the Cup against Darigan Citadel.�</p><p>�����Groans of dismay swept through the rest of the team. </p><p>������They won the Cup last year!� Rinok exclaimed. </p><p>������We don�t stand a chance!� Minae shook her head sadly. </p><p>�����Osielle scowled. �They�re a tough team but so are we!�</p><p>�����Prytariel dipped her head to Osielle in silent agreement. �Right! This is a new season with new strategies and a new teammate. So let�s show those Citadel show-offs what we�re made of!� Prytariel pumped her fist in the air.</p><p>�����The rest of us did the same, the cheer doing the trick of hyping us up for the game ahead. </p><p>�����As I followed my team out onto the field, my mind began to sharpen in preparation for the game ahead. My nerves faded completely now. I had trained for this. I was ready. Or so I thought. </p><p>�����I was almost deafened by the roar of the crowd as we entered the field. I had never heard such noise! We faced off with our opponents that day: Team Darigan Citadel. They leered at us with dark eyes and toothy smirks, as if already confident of their win. Shaye looked especially cocky, standing tall as the crowd chanted his name. </p><p>�����They definitely had the intimidation factor going for them. </p><p>�����I felt a rush of relief as we turned away to take our places on the field. I cast a glance at Rinok, my fellow defender, but he didn�t look at me. His gaze was focused on our opponents. Despite training together for weeks, I had yet to make a real connection with my teammates. I missed having that easy camaraderie but pushed my misgivings aside. </p><p>�����We had a game to win. </p><p>�����It got off to an explosive start, literally, with a clockwork Yooyu. Vickles got the Yooyu first but Osielle kept him busy at the center of the field and didn�t let him anywhere near our goal. The seconds ticked off and the Yooyu exploded. A puff of smoke obscured the field and my heart pounded. I had never played with a clockwork Yooyu before and even though I had been expecting it, I was still shocked by the explosion. </p><p>�����Thankfully, no one was hurt and the game continued. With a normal Yooyu now in play, Vickles once more reached it first. This time, he made his way down the field. I prepared to confront him. No surprise, he slithered straight for me. </p><p>�����What did surprise me is that he slipped right past me, almost faster than I could blink. The goal was scored and I growled, frustrated. </p><p>������Vickles is slippery,� Minae said. �Don�t beat yourself up about it.�</p><p>�����I scowled, trying to figure out how to counter such a sleek opponent. </p><p>�����The entire team groaned as a Darigan Yooyu appeared on the field. They are notoriously tricky to handle and most teams don�t have a strategy to combat them. Most teams excluding DC of course. We didn�t stand a chance. Shaye took the Yooyu with almost zero resistance and scored another goal. </p><p>������No way!� I exclaimed. </p><p>�����My teammates were equally horrified as a second Darigan Yooyu was released onto the field. We barely had time to react before another goal was scored. </p><p>������Oh, this is so much better,� I muttered sarcastically as a mutant Yooyu appeared on the field. </p><p>�����Mutant Yooyus are unpredictable little creatures but sometimes they behave like a normal Yooyu; key word being <i>sometimes</i>. Due to this, gameplay livened up as both teams tried to get it to cooperate. It shot from Vickles� racket and I blocked it, catching it before it could zip past. My exultation didn�t last long, however. Unlike a normal Yooyu, I could feel it moving restlessly in my racket. </p><p>�����I had to pass it quick or risk losing it. Thankfully, I saw Osielle was open and threw the Yooyu his way. He caught the Yooyu and Prytariel kept Vickles and Shaye off him as they raced up the field. I held my breath as I watched, praying to Fyora the pesky little mutant would cooperate. Then Osielle nicked a power-up that expanded our rival�s goal. </p><p>�����Osielle scored!</p><p>�����It was our first goal in the game. DC was tough but this was a glimmer of hope for us. We still had plenty of time on the clock. Perhaps the tide was at last turning in our favour. We could still win this!</p><p>�����A fire Yooyu made an appearance next. I gaped in awe as Shaye made a throw from the center of the field. I could feel the heat of the Yooyu as it scorched past the entire team and directly into the net. My awe quickly turned to disgust. What a show-off!</p><p>�����Fired up by this unnecessary display, I relished the chance to face off with Shaye. I got what I wanted as Shaye hustled down the field. Despite the height difference between us, I used my wings to halt him in his tracks. </p><p>������You�re not getting past me!� I declared, braced to tackle Shaye the second he moved.</p><p>�����Shaye smirked down at me, amused by my challenge. �Is that so?�</p><p>�����My anger boiled, irritated that he was clearly not taking me seriously. �That�s right!�</p><p>������How do you plan on doing that, rookie?� He cocked his head, as if he were actually curious, lightly tossing the Yooyu in his racket. </p><p>�����I narrowed my eyes as I realized it was a faerie Yooyu he held. Faerie Yooyus flew in a curve and this could be combatted by two players standing diagonally to each other. I glanced quickly in my periphery and noticed that Minae was not in a position to block the Yooyu. Why wasn�t she paying attention? Without proper support, I suddenly lost my nerve. </p><p>�����Shaye saw the change in my expression and chuckled. �Well, this has been fun but I�ve got a game to win.� With that, he let the Yooyu fly. </p><p>�����In an elegant arc, it flew around me and directly into the net. </p><p>�����I groaned in frustration as Shaye strode down the field, arms raised in triumph. The crowd went wild as if he had won already. </p><p>�����The next Yooyu was snow and I smiled to myself. All that specialized training was about to pay off! I noticed at once that Prytariel was moving far faster than normal and knew she had picked up the feather that gave players a speed boost. It paired perfectly with the snow Yooyu. I cheered as my captain made our second goal of the game. </p><p>�����The rest of the game was a brutal blur, with almost exclusively mutant and faerie Yooyus in play. We gave it our all, unwilling to go down without a fight. With the help of a freeze power-up, we scored our third goal of the game. Unfortunately, it wasn�t enough. Darigan Citadel absolutely creamed us with a score of 3-15. </p><p>�����So ended my first day in the Altador Cup. </p><p>��������</p><p>����� Even though my first professional game ended in a loss, I didn�t let it get me down. I told myself that today was a new day. This time, we were facing off with Team Meridell. They were a solid team but had yet to move up in the ranks. I felt much better about our chances with this game. </p><p>����� I almost couldn�t believe it when the game started off with another clockwork Yooyu. Once more, there was a brief scuffle over the Yooyu before it exploded in the center of the field. I held my breath as the smoke cleared, only releasing it as I saw no one was hurt. That would take some getting used to. I refocused on the field, hopeful that this game would be different from the first. </p><p>����� It didn�t get easier as a mutant Yooyu came out to play. </p><p>�����Maille-Meridell�s left forward-reached the Yooyu first. Small and fast, he gave Prytariel and Osielle the slip and neared our goal. He came in on Rinok�s side and took the shot but the Yooyu didn�t cooperate. My fellow defender blocked the Yooyu but didn�t think to catch it. I groaned as Maille scooped the Yooyu back into his racket for another shot at the goal, this time making it in. </p><p>����� Next onto the field was a faerie Yooyu. There was a scuffle for control of the Yooyu as it was passed between Meridell�s three offensive players. Prytariel and Osielle were being run ragged out there, badly outnumbered. This time, Windelle came directly at me but before he got too close, he let the Yooyu fly. Though I did my best to stop it, the Yooyu curved directly into the goal. </p><p>����� Our offence got a chance to catch its breath as a Darigan Yooyu wreaked havoc on the field. Both sides did their best but the Yooyu wasn�t having it. It flew haphazardly across the field, bouncing off walls, rackets and goalposts alike. For once, I was thankful to be on defence. At last, by pure chance, it flew into our opponent�s goal. </p><p>����� A couple fire Yooyus helped to bring up our score with another Darigan Yooyu to make things interesting even though this one scored in Meridell�s favour. Then another clockwork Yooyu made an appearance on the field. This time, Osielle grabbed a glove power-up and scored a goal from the center of the field. I cheered, pumping my fist in excitement. This game was going much better than the first. </p><p>����� The game was half over when a fire Yooyu came into play. Osielle reached it first. Trying to offset the three opposing forwards, they tried to initiate a strategy of keep-away but it backfired. Fiorina-Meridell�s right forward-intercepted it and raced down the field, sharp eyes intent on our goal. I braced myself to stop her. </p><p>����� Unfortunately, so did Rinok. As Fiorina came charging towards us, we both leapt in front of the goal to block her. We collided painfully midair and landed in a heap before our goal. I felt the heat of the fire Yooyu as it sailed over our heads and into our net. Rinok growled in frustration, roughly shoving me off as if it were my fault; I ignored him as we resumed our positions before the goal. </p><p>�����It was a close game, with several more clockwork Yooyus making it onto the field. Most of them exploded but my team managed to score with some of them. We held our own against Meridell, up to the last second. A mutant Yooyu finished the game and Meridell managed to score with it. Despite our best effort, we still lost. </p><p>����� I comforted myself that two losses meant nothing in the long run. Things had to get better from here, right?</p><p>��������</p><p>����� I was wrong. </p><p>����� The season wore on. Some games were easier than others and resulted in wins. Others we were completely wiped by clearly superior teams. Each loss got harder for me to take. Yet, I persevered; my team was depending on me. </p><p>����� At the end of the Cup, we had finished in twelfth place, a whole two rankings below Terror Mountain�s place from the previous year. My first year as a professional Yooyuball player did not go as I had imagined. I had not been the fresh young talent they were hoping I would be. I had only made things worse rather than better. I felt sure that I would be released from the team and sent home in disgrace. </p><p>����� �Elbin, we need to talk,� Prytariel delivered the dreaded words as she stood in the doorway to my hotel room. </p><p>����� I nodded glumly, knowing what was coming. </p><p>����� �This season did not go as I had hoped.�</p><p>����� �I know and I�m sorry, Cap-�</p><p>����� Prytariel raised a hand to silence my apology. �This was your first year in the big league. I know how overwhelming that can be.�</p><p>����� �I don�t blame you if you let me go. I know I didn�t live up to your expectations.�</p><p>����� �It�s no surprise that you struggled and none of us blame you for our less than stellar placement this year. At the end of the day, it�s not about any one player�s performance but the team�s overall. We either win or lose together and unfortunately we lost.�</p><p>����� I shook my head, uncertain what to make of this. �So, what are you saying?�</p><p>����� �We�re keeping you on the team, Elbin. Given more training and more experience, I still believe you�ll be an asset to us.�</p><p>����� �Thank you!� I leapt up to hug Prytariel in gratitude for a second chance. </p><p>����� Prytariel laughed and hugged me back. �No need to thank me, Elbin. Just do your best. That�s all I ever ask of my teammates.�</p><p>����� I released Prytariel, determination surging through me. �Next year will be our year!� </p><p>�����<i>To be continued�</i> </p>"

She doesn't, um, know what she’s saying!”</p><p>     Rosalina sighed. “Of course I do! And besides, do you honestly expect <i>me</i> to run the apothecary shop by myself?” She turned to the Werelupe‒who was snarling at her and bearing his surprisingly shiny white teeth‒and said, “You may remove my dear Margo and escort me to your finest guest room, please and thank you.”</p><p>     “You’re NOT staying! I refuse!” Margo fumed, kicking the bars.</p><p>     “SILENCE!” The Werelupe turned from Margo to Rosalina. “If the little girl is willing to take your place, peasant,” he growled to Margo, “then let it be! I’m not going to waste my time with‒”</p><p>     “Excuse me?” Rosalina gasped, placing her hands on her hips. “Who in Neopia do you think you are??”</p><p>     The Werelupe groaned. “What do you want?”</p><p>     “I would like to inform you, hairy beast, that I am not a child,” Rosalina said matter-of-factly, “and if this agreement is to work, you must understand‒”</p><p>     “Enough!” The Werelupe turned back to Margo. “Now, what I was trying to say‒”</p><p>     “Hey! Don’t interrupt me, you uncultured heap of fur and possible petpetpets!” Rosalina made a show of shaking her head furiously.</p><p>     “Rosalina, be careful,” Margo whispered. “Try not to anger the Werelupe that has taken me prisoner.”</p><p>     “Fine.” Rosalina sighed. “But in agreement, we must all state that I was right in this situation while the big hairy thing acted <i>very</i> rude and should be shamed for an eternity.” She smirked, feeling all of her initial fears toward the Werelupe melting away.</p><p>     Facepalming, the Werelupe released Margo and dragged her to the staircase. “Just get out of here!” he snarled viciously. “Leave your idiotic sister here while I give you this one chance to escape!”</p><p>     Margo wriggled out of her captor's grasp and hurried to Rosalina. She gripped her sister's shoulders. “Why in the name of Fyora must you be so impulsive??” Margo crooned. “Don’t you realize what’ll happen to you if you stay??”</p><p>     “Oh, don’t worry about it,” Rosalina said, waving her hand. “I’ll find some way to escape this rundown prison-mansion-thing.”</p><p>     “You,” the Werelupe pointed at Rosalina, “get in there! This cell shall be your home for as long as I see fit! And the other Xweetok should leave right away!”</p><p>     Margo leaned in and whispered, “Please, do take care of yourself. And for the love of Neopia, do NOT push that man’s buttons.”</p><p>     After a quick hug, Rosalina watched her sister hurry out of the tower room and clip-clop down the stairs. Although she felt like running after her and possibly hijacking a carriage on the way home, she stood her ground, knowing she made this decision to save her sister rather than it being something she would benefit from. And, if she had to be totally honest, she was no longer afraid of the annoying Werelupe that seemed even angrier than he was a few minutes ago. <i>Oh well, at least I can hang out around here before I magically escape,</i> Rosalina thought. <i>In the meantime, I’ll see what food this place has.</i></p><p>     “Come with me,” the Werelupe mumbled, heading towards the stairs. “I’ll show you to the ‘guest suite’ you’ve been dying to see.”</p><p>     “Ooh, so I get an actual guest room after all?” Rosalina squealed.</p><p>     “Hurry up!” the Werelupe snarled. “I don’t have all day.”</p><p>     “Fine, Mr Impatient,” Rosalina sighed, following behind. “But this suite better have its own fireplace.”</p><p>     ***</p><p>     “There! Happy now?” The Werelupe pointed to a stone fireplace that stood across from the canopy bed.</p><p>     Rosalina took a glance around the room and shrugged. “Eh.” The dimly-lit room was furnished with a pale purple and white striped wallpaper and shabby purple carpeting. A round magenta and purple rug lay in front of a four poster bed coating with layers of dust. Everything else in the room, from the wooden vanity table and chair to the floor-length mirror half-covered with a white sheet, was unappealing and neglected of any thorough dusting. Rosalina secretly hoped she wouldn’t be forced to clean up this room; the last thing she needed to do around this creepy house was clean a room she was most likely going to escape from in a day or two.</p><p>     “Well, this room is certainly...uh…” Rosalina coughed. “It’s something, all right.”</p><p>     “If you insist on being our guest for who-knows-why, then you must follow some strict rules,” the Werelupe instructed.</p><p>     <i>Whatever.</i> Rosalina yawned.</p><p>     “Firstly, you are not allowed to leave your room unless I say so,” said the Werelupe. “Secondly, you must eat all of your meals here. You are not welcome in the dining room!”</p><p>     <i>Ooh, must be a faboo place to eat food,</i> Rosalina thought.</p><p>     “Thirdly, you must be prepared for any given hour of the day to administer your medicine.” The Werelupe stopped to give a sharp glare. “I sincerely hope that <i>your</i> tactics will suffice much better than your sister’s.”</p><p>     Rosalina shrugged. “Eh, we’ll see what happens.”</p><p>     “Don’t give me that!” The Werelupe spat. “Either you give me results or I show you my wrath!” He snarled, then turned to growl as the starry Meepit from before crept into the room, sniffing the air.</p><p>     “Oooh, how precious!” Rosalina picked up the Meepit, who squirmed in her arms. “What an adorable little thing!” she cooed, snuggling the Meepit to her cheek. “Is this precious bundle of joy yours? Can I call him Precious? Oh, he is just SO CUTE!”</p><p>     “That Meepit isn’t mine,” said the Werelupe gruffly. “But he has been roaming the manor for a week now.”</p><p>     Rosalina gave the Meepit another hug. “Wouldn’t Mr. Snugglyboo be the cutest name ever? Or Mr. Snuggles?”</p><p>     The Werelupe grunted and left, slamming the door shut before locking it. Rosalina was initially too infatuated by the squirmy Meepit to feel afraid by her captor’s startling actions. After deciding to name her new friend Beanie‒the name came to her after twenty-eight minutes of thinking and gushing over the little darling‒she tried opening the door, only to find it was definitely locked.</p><p>     “What a possessive, hairy creepazoid,” Rosalina hissed, kicking the door. “Now how am I supposed to escape this place? A magic portal? Shrink ray?” She turned to Beanie. “Any ideas, darling-boo?”</p><p>     Beanie was busy gnawing on a footstool before looking around the room and scurrying to a window next to the bed. He jumped exceedingly before disappearing underneath the bed, reemerging a few seconds with a cough.</p><p>     “So there are no secret tunnels underneath the bed, huh?” Rosalina examined the window, frowning at the rose-shaped bars that covered it. “For the love of Fyora, who designed this house??” she shrieked. “Geez, did Mr. I’m-hairy-and-scary plan for <i>every</i> single possible escape route to be blocked for giggles or something? What’s his deal?”</p><p>     Frustrated, Rosalina flopped onto the bed, sending a cloud of dust upwards. “This place is going to bore me to snores, my precious petpet,” she sighed, scooping up Beanie and holding him in her lap. “Now how will I escape? Do you think the Draik from that Meridell Castle game will come and break us out?”</p><p>     Beanie squirmed.</p><p>     “I AM SO BORED!” Rosalina shouted to the ceiling before flopping back down.</p><p>     After a long silent spell, with the only sounds being Beanie scurrying around and nibbling on various wooden things, a loud knocking sound thundered through the room. “Girl! I shall be serving you dinner now!” The Werelupe yelled, as if he’d expected Rosalina to be halfway out the window by now.</p><p>     Rosalina threw a pillow at the door. “I refuse to eat whatever you have!” she shouted. “Though if you can manage some carrots for Beanie-boo, that’d be great!”</p><p>     “WHY YOU INSOLENT FOOL!” There was a loud clattering sound, as if the Werelupe dropped something before he walked away.</p><p>     <i>Great, now I’m going to be hungry! That n00b has officially crossed the line!</i> Rosalina rolled onto her stomach, fuming.</p><p>     Beanie scurried over to Rosalina before running towards the room’s other window. Curious, Rosalina followed the Meepit and, when she approached the window, was surprised to see it had no protection bars. At first the thought of a strange creature crawling through to attack her and Beanie was frightening. Then a more rational thought came to her: they could use this window to escape!</p><p>     Rosalina looked at the bed’s lacy canopy. “With that, we’ll surely get out of this horrendous place, Beanie,” she reported to the Meepit, who had scurried back underneath the bed.</p><p>     The canopy was long, but in order to escape successfully, Rosalina knew they needed a second sheet to form some kind of climbing rope. Luckily the bed was covered in a white sheet that, once tied to the canopy, created a rope Rosalina estimated was the right amount to reach the ground. Three wire hangers were converted into a mangled grappling hook, which was tied at the other end of the canopy.</p><p>     <i>Ha! Wait till Margo learns of my daring escape,</i> Rosalina thought as she admired her quickly-thought-up invention. <i>Now all I have to do is get out of here and get home. Then I shall laugh at Margo’s smug face as I pet our adorable new Meepit who would need adoption papers!</i> She laughed out loud. <i>This plan is going to work for sure!</i></p><p>      <i>To be continued…</i> </p>"
