While playing through Neoquest 2 I discovered some guides for the Meridell and Terror Mountain sections that had been posted in the NT but the last 3 areas aren't covered.<p>     After some trial and error through these areas without clear level and skill goals I've put together my own guides for them, enjoy!</p><p>      I recommend you always travel using Hunting unless you need to retreat back to a heal spot. Don't forget to equip any new weapons/armour that are dropped by enemies/bosses as you are going along as well!</p><p>     I also recommend using the lowest healing potions first after battles to top up health, they will be pretty much useless during later battles so there is no point saving them.</p><p>     While battling I would suggest always targeting the same enemy until it is knocked out. Less enemies in the battle means you'll take less damage.</p><p>     Don't sell the Father's Sword, it will be helpful to you later in the game.</p><p>     One final point! Be careful and check who you are attacking with, some weapons will give skills such as Rohane's Combat Focus and when that shows up on the right of the battle screen it's very easy to mistake it for Mipsy's Direct Damage and click it accidentally if you aren't paying attention, wasting a turn.</p><p>      That's all I have to say for now, so let's get on with the guide!</p><p>      Skills</p><p>     The Lost Desert section of Neoquest 2 starts you off in Sakhmet City. By this point, you should be around Level 31 and your stats should look like this:</p><p>     Rohane:</p><p>     Critical Attacks 8: Raging Force</p><p>     Damage Increase 11: Flawless Balance</p><p>     Stunning Strikes 2: Startle</p><p>     Innate Magic Resistance 2: Magic Resistance II</p><p>     Innate Melee Haste 7: Lithe Agility I</p><p>     Mipsy:</p><p>     Direct Damage 11: Vaporize</p><p>     Innate Melee Defense 8: Diversion II</p><p>     Innate Casting Haste 11: Agile Conjuration II</p><p>     Talinia:</p><p>     Increased Bow Damage 10: Strong Bow</p><p>     Multiple Targets 5: Double Shot</p><p>     Shockwave 4: Awful Story</p><p>     Innate Melee Haste 11: Flowing Steps II</p><p>      As you level up you should continue building up these stats evenly and I will be periodically listing what your stats should be so you know roughly where you should be stat wise.</p><p>      Sakhmet City</p><p>     Head out of the city and into the tents to rest, stock up on potions and purchase new weapons/armour. If the damage/defence is only 1 higher than your current equipment I suggest not buying it, it's better to save your money.</p><p>     Equip any better weapons/armour you may have picked up on your way here and sell the rest since you no longer need them.</p><p>     I usually make sure I'm maxed out on all of the healing potions available to buy, pick up at least 1-2 Resurrect potions and 10 Scorch Potions.</p><p>     You should have plenty of Gold to purchase everything you need so when you're done leave the tents and head NorthEast to the Temple of the Sky.</p><p>      Temple of the Sky</p><p>     After entering the Temple, head forward to the gardens then left to the end of the hallway and up the stairs in the last room.</p><p>     On the next floor you need to head down and follow the corridor right and down, heading into the room on the right. Loop around the central room then follow the next corridor left then head up into the central room where you can finally take on Siliclast. After he is defeated, head through the portal to be taken back to Sakhmet City.</p><p>     Right now you should be at around Level 34 and your stats should be close to this:</p><p>     Rohane:</p><p>     Critical Attacks 10: Crushing Impact</p><p>     Damage Increase 11: Flawless Balance</p><p>     Stunning Strikes 3: Daunt</p><p>     Innate Magic Resistance 3: Magic Resistance III</p><p>     Innate Melee Haste 8: Lithe Agility II</p><p>     Mipsy:</p><p>     Direct Damage 12: Destroy</p><p>     Innate Melee Defense 10: Nimbleness I</p><p>     Innate Casting Haste 11: Agile Conjuration II</p><p>     Talinia:</p><p>     Increased Bow Damage 11: Oaken Calm</p><p>     Multiple Targets 6: Third Arrow</p><p>     Shockwave 6: Ill Omen</p><p>     Innate Melee Haste 11: Flowing Steps II</p><p>      Head back out of the city and once again rest and stock up on potions at the tents before making your way to the far North where the Ruined Temple lies. </p><p>      Ruined Temple</p><p>     The first floor is pretty straight forward, just head up then follow the corridor left and up to take the stairs in the top left corner up to the next floor.</p><p>     On the next floor you need to weave your way down the corridor to the bottom, move over to the right and up through the tables and chairs and then finally go up to the top right corner where the stairs are.</p><p>     The third floor has you making your way back over to the top left where yet another staircase awaits you. Head down then follow the hallway left and up. Weave your way down through the barrels and boxes in this room, then follow the corridor left and up to reach the room with the stairs.</p><p>     Finally you've reached the last floor. Head down and take out Gebarn II then head through the portal to be taken back to Sakhmet City once again.</p><p>     You should be around Level 38 by this point and building your stats up evenly.</p><p>     Head back out of the city again and rest and stock up on potions at the tents. Head to the far North again going past the Ruined Temple this time.</p><p>     As you get closer to Waset Village the enemies should stop giving you experience so feel free to switch from Hunting to Normal. Any battles you do encounter you can run from but make sure to keep your health topped up if you fail the Flee and take damage.</p><p>     Don't forget to switch back to Hunting when you reach the Village.</p><p>      Waset Village</p><p>     Waset Village consists of more tents, rest up, stock up on potions and buy any weapons/armour you need.</p><p>     Make sure you pick up Velm while you are here, he is the final member of your team and a much needed healer.</p><p>     You shouldn't need to use many potions from this point on as long as you keep your health topped up with Velm's Group Healing but I still recommend buying them just in case, it's better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>     Again I make sure I'm maxed out on all of the healing potions available to buy, pick up at least 1-2 Resurrect potions and max out Blister Potions.</p><p>     With Velm added to your team, let's take a look at our stats, they should be pretty close to the following:</p><p>     Rohane:</p><p>     Critical Attacks 10: Crushing Impact</p><p>     Damage Increase 11: Flawless Balance</p><p>     Stunning Strikes 3: Daunt</p><p>     Innate Magic Resistance 3: Magic Resistance III</p><p>     Innate Melee Haste 8: Lithe Agility II</p><p>     Mipsy:</p><p>     Direct Damage 13: Eradicate</p><p>     Innate Melee Defense 11: Nimbleness II</p><p>     Innate Casting Haste 12: Agile Conjuration III</p><p>     Talinia:</p><p>     Increased Bow Damage 12: Placid Waters</p><p>     Multiple Targets 7: Rapid Draw</p><p>     Shockwave 7: Grim News</p><p>     Innate Melee Haste 12: Flowing Steps III</p><p>     Velm:</p><p>     Group Healing 10: Mitigation</p><p>     Celestial Hammer 9: Apprentice Blacksmith</p><p>     Innate Melee Defense 8: Diversion II</p><p>     Innate Casting Haste 9: Swift Summoning III</p><p>      Now you have Velm I would suggest targeting the enemy that will attack next, especially with Velm's Celestial Hammer (unless you need to heal, always make healing a priority). If you can pull off a few stuns the enemies will be unable to get any attacks in, which is a huge health saver.</p><p>     When you've spent Velm's points and bought everything you need, leave the tents and head East to the Valley of Kings.</p><p>     The Palace is located SouthWest of the entrance to the Valley of Kings, work your way over there and head on in.</p><p>      Palace of Ancient Kings</p><p>     When you enter, head North then West past the water then NorthWest to the corner room and stand on the left bed to access a secret staircase.</p><p>     Weave your way through the boxes to the room exit in the top right then head up through the cave to reach The Revenant. I like to focus on attacking only him since when you defeat him the Skeletons are defeated too. Take him out and then make sure you speak to Lifira completely before heading through the portal back to the Valley of Kings.</p><p>     Head back NorthEast out of the Valley and head back to Waset Village. Rest, stock up on potions and speak to Lifira completely again, then leave the Village.</p><p>     Go far North then West and speak to Bukaru who will tell you how to find the 2nd Medallion Piece. Make sure you talked to Lifira completely both times or he won't tell you where it is.</p><p>     Go up until you hit the rocks then follow them around East until you get to the Medallion Piece and pick it up.</p><p>     After picking up the 2nd Medallion Piece head East and then South and loop back around past Bledynn to get to Akhten-Ka.</p><p>     Right now you should be at around Level 41 and your stats should be close to this:</p><p>     Rohane:</p><p>     Critical Attacks 11: Destructive Impact</p><p>     Damage Increase 12: Transcendent Grace</p><p>     Stunning Strikes 4: Intimidate</p><p>     Innate Magic Resistance 4: Magical Protection I</p><p>     Innate Melee Haste 9: Lithe Agility III</p><p>     Mipsy:</p><p>     Direct Damage 14: Disintegrate</p><p>     Innate Melee Defense 12: Nimbleness III</p><p>     Innate Casting Haste 13: Battle Voice I</p><p>     Talinia:</p><p>     Increased Bow Damage 13: Still Pond</p><p>     Multiple Targets 8: Trinity Barrage</p><p>     Shockwave 8: Dire Warning</p><p>     Innate Melee Haste 13: Battle Dance I</p><p>     Velm:</p><p>     Group Healing 11: Restoration</p><p>     Celestial Hammer 11: Journeyman Blacksmith</p><p>     Innate Melee Defense 10: Nimbleness I</p><p>     Innate Casting Haste 11: Agile Conjuration II</p><p>      Akhten-Ka</p><p>     This area is pretty straight forward with only one floor. Head to the room in the top left and take down Coltzan's Ghost. When he is defeated, pick up the Medallion Piece in the barrel behind him and backtrack to Bledynn.</p><p>     From Bledynn work your way around and back up and pick up the Medallion Gemstone hidden in the rock pattern to the North.</p><p>     Now go all the way back to the Ruined Temple and head SouthWest to the Pyramid.</p><p>     Once again you can stop by Waset Village if you need to rest and stock up on potions but you shouldn't need to if you've been keeping your health topped up using Velm's Group Healing.</p><p>     As you get closer to Waset Village the enemies should stop giving you experience so feel free to switch from Hunting to Normal. Any battles you do encounter you can run from but make sure to keep your health topped up if you fail the Flee and take damage.</p><p>     Don't forget to switch back to Hunting when you reach the Pyramid.</p><p>      Zakharukh's Pyramid</p><p>     To get to the next floor you need to head up then move around in a giant S towards the bottom left and finally head up to find the stairs.</p><p>     On this floor head down then right to the gap in the wall to the north. Make your way to either gap on the left or right then go to the center where the stairs await.</p><p>     Head up to take down Anubits and that's all of the Lost Desert taken care of.</p><p>     Right now you should be at around Level 44 and your stats should be close to this:</p><p>     Rohane:</p><p>     Critical Attacks 12: Devastating Impact</p><p>     Damage Increase 13: Swordmaster</p><p>     Stunning Strikes 5: Surprise</p><p>     Innate Magic Resistance 5: Magical Protection II</p><p>     Innate Melee Haste 10: Flowing Steps I</p><p>     Mipsy:</p><p>     Direct Damage 15: Obliterate</p><p>     Innate Melee Defense 14: Finesse II</p><p>     Innate Casting Haste 15: Battle Voice III</p><p>     Talinia:</p><p>     Increased Bow Damage 14: Rock Steady</p><p>     Multiple Targets 9: Cluster Shot</p><p>     Shockwave 9: Shocking Information</p><p>     Innate Melee Haste 14: Battle Dance II</p><p>     Velm:</p><p>     Group Healing 11: Restoration</p><p>     Celestial Hammer 11: Journeyman Blacksmith</p><p>     Innate Melee Defense 10: Nimbleness I</p><p>     Innate Casting Haste 11: Agile Conjuration II</p><p>      Congratulations on beating the Lost Desert section of Neoquest 2. Take a well earned break then move on to the Haunted Woods :) </p>
