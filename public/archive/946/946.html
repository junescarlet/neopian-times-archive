Fragments of different worlds, like a piece of Meridellian farmstead or a chunk of desert, peppered the otherwise dark wall. Upon approaching the spotlight, Jeran noticed a shaking, huddling form. They had ceased their squalling, perhaps from wearing themselves to the point of exhaustion. As bad as it made him feel to think it, he was thankful for the moment of quiet. He studied the creature with caution. A blanket wrapped around their body like a tunic; even then, they still quaked like a leaf in the wind. Perhaps they were cold? But no, that wasn’t it. The room felt pleasant, almost comfortable, compared to the frigid conditions in Terror Mountain. The fact that Jeran could not see their eyes made him uneasy. Who knew what or who from their childhood could be beneath the shadows? Jeran turned his head this way and that to get a better look, but they held their head between their knees. Long ears came up in stalks from the figure and flopped down towards the middle. And from behind their blanket tunic, there was a long, thick tail that lay flat across the ground. A Blumaroo. They were a Blumaroo.<p> <div align=right>-- <a href="index.phtml?section=584477&issue=946">parody_ham</a></div></div> <hr noshade size=1> <!-- Featured Story Touts --> <table cellspacing=0 cellpadding=6 border=0 width=100%> <tr> <td valign=top width=50%><div align=center><h1>Haunted Woods Travel Guide</h1><br><a href="index.phtml?section=585477&week=946"><img src=https://images.neopets.com/nt/ntimages/258_kacheek_woods.gif width=150 height=150 alt border=0 class=story_img></a></div><br><div align=justify>Who else has found themselves having the nearly irresistible urge to visit some of Neopia’s darker worlds?

Instead of submitting a story that is wholly yours, you must adapt to the ongoing Storytelling plot by writing what happens next, with a unique and interesting twist or development. Years ago, the STC was especially competitive, with many highly skilled storytellers always raising the bar and pushing newcomers to new heights. Though the STC is quieter nowadays, the challenge is still there, especially now that there are only five winning entries picked per week, sometimes less. For a long time, it was the judge who started the story, and then left it for users to continue. Today, a user now has the option to submit a starter or a beginning instead of continuing an ongoing story.

Let’s get the perspective of someone from the inside. Kep: “I appreciate the fact that you waited until after the finals to ask for an interview; there are so many buffoons who pay no heed to the fact that we need to focus on our preparation and not their stupid questions.” Skaata: “Ehehe, well, I hope the questions I’ve prepared pass muster! Now, let’s get it out of the way – the rumour about the Darigan Yooyus in the match with Kiko Lake. You know about it?” Kep: “Erugh. Yes, I’ve heard about it.

Looking around at the ravages of a party gone wrong, the only thing that the Ruki could think was that her day was not supposed to end like this. ~ ~ ~ It was Korbat Day.

The reason behind them going on this mini adventure, was because Oohee had a few friends mention just how lovely the Island was and that there were loads to do there. Plus they said she could bring Claude along with her as they allowed petpets - as long as he doesn't run off and stays with Oohee it should be fine. No problem there Oohee thought to herself.
