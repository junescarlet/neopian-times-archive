We gather here today to recognize the hard work and tireless efforts of the contributors of the Neopian Times for an entire six hundred and fifty issues!<p>From its humble beginnings, the Neopian Times has grown from a picture-less, navigation-less, simple web-page, to the times we know today. Included are informative articles, hilarious comics, endearing short stories, and even an editorial where loyal readers can send their questions, thoughts, and thanks.</p><p>Of course, none of this could be possible without the dedication of the Times' editors, Droplet and Snowflake, and those lovely little weewoos that make sure your weekly issue is delivered on time. Now, if you have been following this series from the beginning, you will know where this is going, and if you are a new reader, we here at Neopian Fashions have a special way of showing our appreciation.
