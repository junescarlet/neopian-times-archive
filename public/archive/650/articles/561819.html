This is it!! Come one, come all and explore the following advice consisting of six wealth-creating concepts, five applications of those concepts, followed by a zero excuses policy. These are the tips the very best and wealthiest players use to rise to the top.<p><b>Concepts</b> </p><p><b>1) Passive Income</b> </p><p> We all have lives away from Neopets and cannot play 24/7. Passive income or income you can earn when you are not online is a wonderful way to keep increasing your wealth even when you can't be here. The primary sources of passive income are a shop and the stock market. A large bank account can also earn a nice chunk of Neopoints in daily interest. The effort that it takes to run a really large, main market shop, probably isn't worth the investment, however, having at least a size 20 shop (100 items) is definitely a good investment. If you make at least 1000 Neopoints profit on each item and turn over every item at least weekly, that is easily 100k a week, for very little effort. There's no reason to think you can't make 100k a day or even more with a well-run shop. The stock market is the epitome of passive income. It takes only seconds to buy 1000 shares of whatever is selling at 15 (minimum buy price) each day and then selling any stocks trading at 300% or more.</p><p><b>2) Opportunity for Huge Profits</b> </p><p>Some activities on Neopets present an opportunity for huge profits. Restocking, especially of specific items in certain shops is one. Restocking very rare, highly desired items is the pinnacle of the buy low, sell high, philosophy. A few of the shops that restock these items are—stamps, collectable cards, coins, shells, magic and a few of the Petpet shops. There is a fantastic return on investment with these items. For example, the Scowling Sloth Coin restocks for 8k and sells for around 9 million. Keep in mind that all of these shops are also highly competitive and difficult to restock in, requiring patience and a good measure of luck. A few easier places to potentially reap huge profits are sniping (buying highly valuable items from user shops or the auction house) and games of chance (see risk-taking section below).</p><p><b>3) Play Games Smarter</b> </p><p>Instead of just playing your favorite games each day, times three, play games smarter. Look at the ratios and play games that will give you maximum Neopoints of 1000 (x3) with minimum time. The saying "Time is Money," can be re-written as "Time is Neopoints," which doesn't have the same ring to it but is equally true. None of us has unlimited time, so making the most Neopoints in the shortest amount of time is just plain smarter. Other ways to maximize your time spent playing games is to use the challenge a friend feature (you can wager up to 10k per game), play the daily feature game for twice the Neopoints per score and play World Challenge. Each time you win a World Challenge you earn a map piece which can be sold (in your shop!) for anywhere from 10k to 99k or you can collect 20 pieces from the same world and turn them in for a prize.</p><p><b>4) Take Risks </b> </p><p>The wealthiest players know that risk-taking is a huge part of Neopets. Make playing Bagatelle, Slots (Brucey B and Black Pawkeet), the lottery, scratch cards, etc. a part of your Neopets routine. Bonuses to these games include the opportunity for earning spiffy trophies! The odds on Neopets are much more favorable than real life. Food Club is another activity that involves betting and offers a fantastic return on investment. If you're not familiar with Food Club and want to get started, there are a multitude of guides and boards related to the topic. If you don't feel comfortable creating your own bets, many Neopians publish their bets daily and allow other players to copy them, check the Neo-boards or the Neopian Times for more details on getting started. </p><p><b>5) Build Wealth Regularly</b> </p><p>This concept is somewhat obvious, however, it is important, even with passive income you need to be online regularly to collect it and to replenish your supply—be it interest, stocks or shop keeping. It doesn't require a lot of time but a daily investment will provide the greatest returns to your wealth-building activities. Time management is important as well. Rather than wasting an hour being financially unproductive, develop a plan to maximize your earning potential. Which activities will you do daily? How about weekly or monthly? </p><p><b>6) Develop a Niche</b> </p><p>Find a few places where you excel and form your own unique niche. Maybe it is buying Gold Brightvale Job Coupons, doing the Brightvale jobs and reselling the pink coupons. Maybe it is auction sniping or reselling (generally buying items over 99k and making a profit). Whatever it is, developing a string of individual niches can really help bolster your income potential. Also, if it's something that you can afford, consider becoming a Premium member. There are a multitude of financially lucrative bonuses to premium from access to the super shop wiz to exclusive nerkmid-awarding battledome challengers to extra random events and scratchcards.</p><p><b>Applications</b> </p><p><b>A) Attempt a New Method</b> </p><p>One way to apply these concepts is to try something new. Never played World Challenge? Now is a great time to learn. Attempt some jobs at the Employment Agency—either with or without job coupons. Start playing Food Club regularly—find someone who publishes and updates their bets daily and copy them. Maybe now is a great time to clean your SDB and start a shop, as the items sell, see if you can keep your inventory full by adding newly restocked items.</p><p><b>B) Be Persistent</b> </p><p>Often when developing a new skill or trying a new method of earning, we get frustrated. Maybe you're going to attempt to restock but so far all you've done is loose Neopoints. It takes time to develop a new skill—just like improving a game score—a short time spent practicing daily can have dramatic results. Whatever it is start slow, set small goals for yourself and above all else—be persistent.</p><p><b>C) Set an Earnings Goal</b> </p><p>Break it down. Are you going to try to earn 5 million in a month? How much do you need to add to your savings account daily or weekly to manage that? How will you earn those Neopoints? Break it into segments, set a goal and watch your bank account flourish.</p><p><b>D) Have a System</b> </p><p>Create an earnings (and spending) cycle. We all have things to spend our Neopoints on but creating a system for savings and spending can help reel in those out-of-control or unproductive spending habits. I try to keep a certain amount of Neopoints on hand for restocking, training, daily expenses, etc. The rest I deposit in 100k chunks. I also attempt not to withdraw Neopoints unless it is a planned major expense. Another method is to work really hard on savings from days 1-20 of each month and then ease up or allow yourself to spend rather than save for the remainder of the month.</p><p><b>E) Track your Progress</b> </p><p>Watching your savings grow is a thrill! Knowing you are getting closer to whatever major expenditure you have planned is very rewarding as well. I highly recommend tracking your progress in a way that is significant to you. Applying even some of the above suggestions will launch you onto the earnings fast track. </p><p>Now you have this guide full of wealth-building ideas and inspirations.
