Within this article, I will list 15 of Neopia's feline petpets and why you should own one today! Any of them would make a great addition to any Neopian's family. Without further ado, and in no particular order, here are the pawsitively adorable petpets you've been waiting for.<p><b><i> (I take no responsibility for any harm or mental pain that comes from the reading of these pawsome puns... Okay, I apologize for the last one. I can almost guarantee that there will be no more puns here on out.) </i></b> </p><p><img height=80 src=//images.neopets.com/items/petpet_babyca.gif width=80></p><p><b>15. Babyca</b> </p><p>"Curious, mischievous and extremely fast, Babycas can be quite a handful to look after." </p><p>Don't let their description scare you! Babyca may be a lot to take care of, but they are a loving little petpet. Plus, who doesn't love a little mischievousness every once in a while? While dealing with the Babyca's mischief might be cumbersome at times, it will also provide much entertainment for all involved. The Babyca is the perfect addition to any Neopian family who is looking for a little more liveliness in their lives. Yes, I'm talking to you, Zombie and Ghost Neopians! </p><p><img height=80 src=//images.neopets.com/items/angelpuss_devilpuss.gif width=80></p><p><b>14. Devilpuss</b> </p><p>"A scary little fiend that is anything but sweet and adorable!"</p><p>Sure, they're a little scary and a little less sweet than your average feline companion. This may be exactly what you need, though. Have you ever been worried about a thief breaking into your neohome? Well, meet your new guard kitty. Any thief that comes across your home will be sent fleeing in fear from your Devilpuss. Just make sure that your Devilpuss doesn't turn on you. I'm sure you can find someone willing to train your Devilpuss somewhere...</p><p><img height=80 src=//images.neopets.com/items/angelpuss.gif width=80></p><p><b>13. Angelpuss</b> </p><p>"Angelpi are sweet adorable little kitties for your Neopet to look after."</p><p>Ahh, now here is that sweet, lovable feline that you've been searching for. If you've ever wanted a lap warmer, then search no farther. The Angelpuss is the exact opposite of its Devilpuss brethren. While you probably shouldn't count on an Angelpuss stopping any thieves anytime soon, this cute kitty will always be there for you... so long as you pet and pamper him or her. And of course be sure that you only pet and pamper the Angelpuss when he or she wants you to. Otherwise, expect a nasty scratch and the feeling of betrayal that your once completely lovable friend could turn on you so suddenly and then finding yourself living in fear of your feline friend's constant mood changes, where eventually you have to hide from your Angelpuss because they have become the new overlord of the house... Sorry, what were we talking about again?</p><p><img height=80 src=//images.neopets.com/items/mauket.gif width=80></p><p><b>12. Mauket</b> </p><p>"The Mauket is a sleek Petpet who loves to sleep for hours on end in its bed!"</p><p>Ahem, anyways. The Mauket is another great candidate to become the newest addition to your neo-family. This petpet is also great for those who would rather have a low maintenance petpet. The Mauket are big on their catnaps. Most likely, with how sneaky they are, the Mauket will spend their days lazing about in a secret hiding spot. Of course, be careful for the Mauket is always there. Watching. Waiting. So be sure to keep that in mind the next time you're browsing the Neopian Times to see what canine petpets there are for sale.</p><p><img height=80 src=//images.neopets.com/items/crystacat_yellow.gif width=80></p><p><b>11. Crystacat</b> </p><p>"Crystacats demand lots of care and attention. When not properly looked after they can get incredibly moody."</p><p>Crystacats are pretty much the opposite of the Mauket. While the Mauket is for a neo-family that would prefer a low maintenance petpet, the Crystacat is for a neo-family that wants a high maintenance petpet and has a lot of time to spend on taking care of him or her. Crystacats are pretty needy when it comes to their care, but they also will love and cherish their owners as long as they are given the amount of care they desire. Before getting a Crystacat, make sure you have the time that it takes to take care of these loving feline petpets.</p><p><img height=80 src=//images.neopets.com/items/pets_blooky.gif width=80></p><p><b>10. Blooky</b> </p><p>"Blooky is a cross between a Triffin and an Angelpuss."</p><p>The Blooky might not be the most adorable feline in the world, but don't let their looks fool you. They are lovable and sweet, just like their Angelpuss counterparts and the Triffin is known for seeing things nobody else can with its third magical eye. It's hard to say if the Blooky inherited this trait or not, but what better way to find out than by owning one yourself. Imagine the wonders of knowing things that nobody else does! This mysterious petpet is definitely an interesting addition to any neo-family looking for a unique petpet.</p><p><img height=80 src=//images.neopets.com/items/gpp_blugar.gif width=80></p><p><b>9. Blugar</b> </p><p>"The pattern on the coat of the Blugar is never the same."</p><p>The Blugar is a mysterious petpet. The pattern on its coat is never the same, so if you get more than one, it may be difficult to distinguish between them. Therefore, it may be better to just own one Blugar at a time. This feline petpet is also a little wilder than the average feline petpet. Make sure to give this petpet plenty of room to explore, otherwise he or she may start to feel too cramped in a smaller space. Any neo-family looking for a more exotic feline petpet has come to the right place if they decide to get a Blugar.</p><p><img height=80 src=//images.neopets.com/items/schnelly.gif width=80></p><p><b>8. Schnelly</b> </p><p>"Schnelly may be cross-eyed, but she's not making faces at you! She loves to be held and will want nothing more than to curl up in your Neopets arms all day!" </p><p>The Schnelly is an adorable fluffy little feline petpet that loves nothing more than being near you. If you're looking for a close companion petpet than the Schnelly is for you! She may be cross-eyed, but that does not take away from her adorableness. Do you find yourself spending days at your neohome alone? Well, the Schnelly is the petpet for you. She loves to be near you and keep you company. You will never feel lonely again as long as you have a Schnelly.</p><p><img height=80 src=//images.neopets.com/items/gpp_taigar.gif width=80></p><p><b>7. Taigar</b> </p><p>"Oddly enough the brightly coloured stripes help Taigars blend into the natural habitat."</p><p>The Taigar is another wilder feline petpet, similar to the Blugar. Taigars are definitely more exotic than your average feline petpet and seem to prefer the outdoors rather than being cooped up inside. If you enjoy going on long adventures and are looking for a companion to join you, the Taigar might be the feline petpet for you! Of course, just don't expect the Taigar to be a feline petpet who wants to cuddle.</p><p><img height=80 src=//images.neopets.com/items/shpp_biyako_white.gif width=80></p><p><b>6. Biyako</b> </p><p>"The feisty Biyako is known for its hunting skills and its ability to be extremely quiet." </p><p>If you enjoy hunting or would like to travel stealthily, then the Biyako is the feline petpet for you. The Biyako have a feisty temperament, so be sure you can handle that kind of attitude. If you are able to gain the Biyako's respect, then you may very well have the ideal hunting partner. While the Biyako may certainly be a handful at first, with time, the Biyako may be a very loyal and reliable ally in any Neopian's journeys. </p><p><img height=80 src=//images.neopets.com/items/pet_gathow.gif width=80></p><p><b>5. Gathow</b> </p><p>"Gathow is a very strange pet. It never blinks its eyes and you never know when they are sleeping because their eyes never ever close." </p><p>The Gathow is a feline that is always alert. It never closes its eyes, so it always is observing the world and looking for any immediate danger. The Gathow is another good candidate to be a guard kitty. Even while it's asleep, the Gathow sleeps with its eyes open and, thus, can be awake within seconds of detecting any dangerous activity. As long as having a feline petpet that is always staring at you does not unnerve you then the Gathow could be a great new feline friend for any Neopian. </p><p><img height=80 src=//images.neopets.com/items/petpet_meowclops_black.gif width=80></p><p><b>4. Meowclops</b> </p><p>"This friendly creature sees all; however it probably won't know what to do with it." </p><p>The Meowclops is not just good for an avatar. This feline petpet is also a great companion for any Neopian. Even though they only have one eye, Meowclops see all and are very observant. Sure, they may not know what to do with what they see, but they are still a helpful companion to have around. Meowclops are very friendly and are very loyal to their owners. The Meowclops are well known for their avatar, but remember, they also make a great petpet! </p><p><img height=80 src=//images.neopets.com/items/pet_winter_3.gif width=80></p><p><b>3. Tasu</b> </p><p>"These smart Petpets can be trained to do all kinds of cool tricks with a little patience."</p><p>Tasu are an intelligent feline petpet. Don't take them for granted, they can be trained just as well (and possibly even better) than any canine petpet ever could. Tasu are adorable little feline petpets, who would be great for the pet that wants to have a petpet who can do neat tricks. Show off the Tasu's skills to any neofriend and they may be tempted to get a Tasu too! Just make sure to stay patient when training the Tasu.</p><p><img height=80 src=//images.neopets.com/items/kadoatie.gif width=80></p><p><b>2. Kadoatie</b> </p><p>"Kadoatie is what we like to call a pain in the neck. When it is bedtime and the lights go out, the Kadoatie cries continuously until you turn them back on. I hope you like to sleep with the lights on." </p><p>Kadoatie are adorable feline petpets, but they might be considered a little bit high maintenance when it comes to their care. They are very specific about what kinds of foods they want, so if you plan on being a Kadoatie owner, be prepared to constantly be changing their diet based on their ever-changing whims and appetite. They also have very specific desires as to how their bed should be, the lighting of the room, the temperature of their water, the temperature of the room, the type of brush you use to pet them, the... okay, so they might be very high maintenance when it comes to their care. If their cuteness is so undesirable to you that you are willing to take on their many needs then just be prepared for what is in store for you. </p><p><img height=80 src=//images.neopets.com/items/petpet_advc2012_plumpy_ap.gif width=80></p><p><b>1. Plumpy</b> </p><p>"Plumpy demands BACON. This was given out by the Advent Calendar in Y14." </p><p>Last, but certainly not least, the Plumpy is also a great feline addition to any neo-family. They may look grumpy, but that's just because their appetite for bacon is just completely insatiable. Be sure to have plenty of bacon on hand if you plan on owning a Plumpy. As long as you have bacon, then you should have nothing to fear. The Plumpy is a perfectly lovable feline friend that loves nothing more than to curl up in a ball with a nice piece of bacon. I think all Neopians can understand the Plumpy's ravenous appetite for bacon. If you happen to be a bacon lover, then the Plumpy is definitely the perfect feline petpet for you. </p><p>Well, I hope this list gave you something to pawnder when it comes to finding the perfect feline companion to add to your neo-family. (I said that I <i>almost</i> guaranteed there would be no more puns.) Get out there and find your new feline friend today! Thank you for reading and happy 650th Neopian Times!!</p><p> </p>
