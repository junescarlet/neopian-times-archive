<font size=5>T</font>hrough the lush green fields in the land of Meridell,<p>There exists a story that is the greatest to tell.</p><p>It is a story told by the young and the old;</p><p>The greatest of stories about a hero bold.</p><p>Listen to my story. From its lessons do not turn.</p><p>For in it is a message we all should learn.</p><p>In a modest dwelling lived one named Adrianne,</p><p>And she was the greatest sorceress in all the land.</p><p>With her magic staff, she protected the weak.</p><p>She protected the forsaken and the meek.</p><p>Her talents were legendary in times that were dire,</p><p>But the faerie Uni had grown old and wanted to retire.</p><p>She needed a successor and she wanted to find,</p><p>A hero who was worthy and one of a kind.</p><p>She composed three letters for such heroes one day,</p><p>And used her magic to send her requests on their way.</p><p>Through magical currents, her letters found their mark.</p><p>She requested that these heroes to her home embark.</p><p>One was a blue Skeith by the name of Sir Gary.</p><p>His strength and his brawn were more than legendary.</p><p>He was afraid of nothing – absolutely zero.</p><p>In his hometown, he was already a hero.</p><p>Concerning this situation, he was not deceived.</p><p>He immediately left the moment the letter was received.</p><p>Brian the Brave was the second called to come.</p><p>Of all Neopia's archers, he was the greatest one.</p><p>A calm, cool Gelert with his arrow and his bow;</p><p>Exactly how good he was, only he did know.</p><p>Like Sir Gary, he came when he was called.</p><p>This was the kind of opportunity he wouldn't have stalled.</p><p>The last hero was so mysterious even with her fame.</p><p>Little was known beyond that of her name.</p><p>They called her Ellisa and she was said to be smart.</p><p>She had turned the skill of being stealthy into an art.</p><p>Unless she chose otherwise, she could remain unseen,</p><p>And her talents rounded out this competent team.</p><p>The Skeith and Brian met on the way as they walked. </p><p>And as they continued on, the two began to talk. </p><p>They knew each other for they had met in the past.</p><p>Talking, they continued down the path with steps fast.</p><p>Both were eager to meet Ellisa who was still a mystery,</p><p>Even though they had heard of some of her history.</p><p>Soon they came to a Cybunny sitting in the road.</p><p>Sir Gary asked, "Are you here to carry our load?"</p><p>They didn't give her time to answer well,</p><p>As they unloaded their items to this Cybunny frail.</p><p>They were big and strong where she was tiny and pink.</p><p>As to her real identity, they didn't even think.</p><p>Soon they came to the gate and saw Adrianne there. </p><p>"Welcome, great heroes!" she shouted with flair. </p><p>"I see Sir Gary with strength and size. </p><p>And you must be Brian, I would surmise." </p><p>Then her eyes saw the Cybunny struggling behind.</p><p>"And you must be Ellisa – the stealthy and kind."</p><p>The two other heroes were shocked and amazed,</p><p>That one so small could be a hero left them dazed.</p><p>The fact that she wasn't even stealthy was at least funny.</p><p>How could she be a hero, this little Cybunny?</p><p>They held back their comments, but even without words,</p><p>It appeared Ellisa knew what they thought of her.</p><p>She stood up straight, although not very tall,</p><p>And dropped all of the stuff so to the ground it did fall.</p><p>There was a power hidden in her irises blue,</p><p>So that even the others had to agree it might be true.</p><p>On her tiny appearance, they no longer did dwell.</p><p>After all, Adrianne surely would have picked her heroes well.</p><p>"I called you all here," Adrianne confidently said,</p><p>"Because of a matter that I truly dread. </p><p>I have grown old. Oh, the years, they truly fly! </p><p>And I need someone to take my place by and by.</p><p>You each have great skills, but I need to know who is best.</p><p>That's why I'm sending you all on a special quest." </p><p>"A quest?" repeated the Skeith. "Is that what you want us to do? </p><p>Tell me what it is you need, and I will bring it to you."</p><p>Adrianne replied, "There is no need to hurry,</p><p>But I'll tell you what I want. Do no worry.</p><p>I've chosen a job that will test each of you three.</p><p>You must acquire a Weewoo of jewels from a tree."</p><p>The Uni continued, "It sounds like an easy task,</p><p>But it really it is much more that I ask.</p><p>Along the way in the woods, obstacles have been placed.</p><p>These are the hurdles that must be faced.</p><p>After all this, you will come to a tree tall,</p><p>From whose heights you surely wouldn't want to fall.</p><p>"At the top of the tree between two branches askew,</p><p>You will find wedged a jeweled Weewoo.</p><p>Its body is of gold and many jewels you will see.</p><p>Remove it from its deadly perch and bring it to me.</p><p>When this is done, I will think of your pace,</p><p>And then I will choose the hero that shall take my place."</p><p>Their task explained, they were pointed to the path to begin,</p><p>And they begin their trek walking against the wind.</p><p>The Skeith was noisy. He felt sure he would succeed.</p><p>Laughing and joking, he thought this an easy deed.</p><p>The brown Gelert spoke less, but his spirits were stirred.</p><p>Only Ellisa remained quiet without speaking a word.</p><p>The path twisted between two shear rocks,</p><p>And by a huge boulder, the path was blocked.</p><p>This rock was stuck firmly in the ground.</p><p>There was no way for them to get around.</p><p>This was the first obstacle. This much was true.</p><p>Sir Gary realized what he needed to do.</p><p>The Skeith grabbed the rock, and without a care</p><p>He threw the rock up into the air.</p><p>It came down with a thud and then went flyin'</p><p>Down the bank right toward Ellisa and Brian.</p><p>Ellisa grabbed Brian and pulled him out of the way.</p><p>"Oops," was all Sir Gary had to say.</p><p>They continued on until they came to a ravine so wide.</p><p>Their path continued on the other side.</p><p>But the bridge had been cut. There was no way to cross.</p><p>For a minute the questers seemed quite lost.</p><p>But then Brian smiled and chuckled low.</p><p>Almost casually, he pulled out his bow.</p><p>He shot an arrow that flew just right,</p><p>And into the faraway tree, it became stuck tight.</p><p>A rope had been tied to this arrow,</p><p>Which showed that Brian was a clever fellow.</p><p>Tying the other end of the rope to a tree</p><p>He create a makeshift bridge for the three.</p><p>Brian quickly climbed across the chasm first</p><p>But then he did something that really was the worst.</p><p>It was an act almost too hard to grope.</p><p>He pulled out the arrow and released the rope,</p><p>Leaving the others in a terrible strife</p><p>Until Ellisa pulled out a knife.</p><p>She shoved the knife into the ravine wall</p><p>And caught ahold of Sir Gary before he could fall.</p><p>She slowly climbed and didn't dare stop</p><p>Until her and Sir Gary made it to the top.</p><p>She screamed at Brian, "What are you daft?"</p><p>The Gelert only looked at her and laughed.</p><p>They began walking again as it had grown late,</p><p>Until they reached a tall tree surrounded by a gate.</p><p>This locked gate was made of tempered steel,</p><p>And it refused to open with force or will.</p><p>There was a sign that hung squarely in the middle</p><p>That said the gate would open if they solved a riddle.</p><p>The posted sign said to stand in one spot</p><p>And to perform the riddle answer that was sought.</p><p>The riddle itself said, "This isn't just a game."</p><p>"I am so fragile, I break at the sound of my name."</p><p>Sir Gary and Brian looked confused completely,</p><p>But Ellisa stepped forward to the spot immediately.</p><p>To their surprise, this Cybunny they thought was weak,</p><p>Stood in the spot, but not a word did she speak.</p><p>"What do you think you're doing?" Brian cried,</p><p>But at the moment the gate swung open wide.</p><p>Ellisa said, "You might have thought that I was being lame,</p><p>But silence is the thing broken when you speak its name."</p><p>With the gate open, they could climb up the bark </p><p>And retrieve the jeweled Weewoo before it got dark. </p><p>Ellisa was the smallest and the lightest you see,</p><p>So she was volunteered by the others to climb up the tree.</p><p>She hurried up the tree, careful not to fall</p><p>Until she had the jeweled Weewoo firmly in her paw. </p><p>When Ellisa climbed down, Adrianne did appear. </p><p>She took the Weewoo saying, "Thank you, my dear.</p><p>You three faced all the obstacles. You weren't perplexed.</p><p>So who should follow in my footsteps?</p><p>Each one of you can tell me why you should be picked.</p><p>I must choose before nightfall, so please make it quick."</p><p>"I am the strongest," Sir Gary shouted to the trees,</p><p>"I took care of the huge boulder with ease.</p><p>Of all of us here, it should hardly be news.</p><p>I am the only one you can really choose!</p><p>I am the hero that all the villains will dread."</p><p>But it appeared Brian didn't agree with what was said.</p><p>Brian began, "You are strong, but do you know what?</p><p>I am the archer who is the surest shot.</p><p>I was the one who, while at the ridge,</p><p>Shot the arrow to create a bridge.</p><p>This is a decision that shouldn't even be rough."</p><p>Throughout all of this, Ellisa hadn't spoke up.</p><p>Adrianne looked at the Cybunny with a gentle smile.</p><p>She said, "You have been quiet all the while. </p><p>On this quest, what did you do? </p><p>Was the riddle solved by you?</p><p>Do you think you could be a great hero?"</p><p>To everyone's surprise, she answered, "No." </p><p>She continued, "I have bad news that I must break. </p><p>I am not Ellisa! There has been some mistake.</p><p>You see, I got the letter by accident.</p><p>I knew of Ellisa, for whom it was meant.</p><p>I am a simple Cybunny by the name of Mary,</p><p>But the idea of being nobody was so scary.</p><p>"I decided, once I got the magical letter,</p><p>To pretend to be Ellisa, although I knew better.</p><p>I just wanted, for once, to be a someone,</p><p>And I have to admit this quest was quite fun.</p><p>Yet, I am certainly no hero, for I have lied."</p><p>She dropped her head and began to cry. </p><p>Yet, Adrianne's smile hadn't even changed. </p><p>She announced, "Things have gone as arranged.</p><p>You are part of this group because you belong.</p><p>It was the name on the letter that was wrong.</p><p>I used my magic to send for three for this test</p><p>And it was my magic that decided you were the best.</p><p>"Brian and Sir Gary, I sent for by name.</p><p>But they are more interested in their own fame.</p><p>You, who in this group never seem to mesh,</p><p>Were the only one to appeared unselfish.</p><p>You have the honesty, brains, and heart.</p><p>It is those traits that have set you apart."</p><p>Mary was appointed the successor on that day,</p><p>And from that path she never did stray.</p><p>Sir Gary and Brain an apology did mumble</p><p>And they returned home, ultimately humbled.</p><p>A good lesson was learned by one and all.</p><p>Helping others first is a true hero's call. </p><p><b>The End</b> </p><p> </p>
